Error AccessControlListNotSupported when trying to create a bucket ACL in AWS

Recently I tried to deploy an aws_s3_bucket_acl resource using Terraform, and received the error:

Error: error creating S3 bucket ACL for bucket-name: AccessControlListNotSupported: The bucket does not allow ACLs │ status code: 400

I didn't see why this wouldn't create. However I checked AWS docs [1 2] and looks like they recent had an update as of April 2023 that disabled ACLs by default.

The error `AccessControlListNotSupported` occurs because, as of April 2023, Amazon S3 has disabled ACLs (Access Control Lists) by default for new buckets. This change is part of an ongoing effort by AWS to enhance security and simplify bucket permissions management.

To resolve this issue, you have a couple of options:

### Option 1: Use Bucket Policies Instead of ACLs
AWS recommends using bucket policies to manage access permissions. Bucket policies offer finer-grained control over permissions and are easier to manage.

1. **Remove the `aws_s3_bucket_acl` resource from your Terraform configuration.**
2. **Create or update an S3 bucket policy to manage permissions.** Here is an example of how you can define a bucket policy in Terraform:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "your-bucket-name"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "example" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Sid       = "PublicReadGetObject"
        Effect    = "Allow"
        Principal = "*"
        Action    = "s3:GetObject"
        Resource  = "${aws_s3_bucket.example.arn}/*"
      },
    ]
  })
}
```

### Option 2: Enable ACLs for the Bucket
If you still need to use ACLs, you can enable ACLs for your bucket. This is not recommended by AWS, but if necessary, here is how you can do it:

1. **Modify the bucket to enable ACLs.** Note that this must be done using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI, as Terraform currently does not support enabling ACLs directly.

Using AWS CLI:
```sh
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket your-bucket-name --acl private
aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket your-bucket-name --acl private
```

2. **After enabling ACLs, deploy the `aws_s3_bucket_acl` resource using Terraform.**

### Summary
AWS now disables ACLs by default to encourage the use of bucket policies. The best approach is to use bucket policies to manage your permissions. If you absolutely need to use ACLs, you can enable them via the AWS CLI or Management Console and then proceed with your Terraform configuration.

The error message you're encountering, "AccessControlListNotSupported," suggests that the AWS S3 bucket you are attempting to configure does not support the use of Access Control Lists (ACLs). As you noted, AWS made a change in April 2023, where ACLs are disabled by default on new S3 buckets to encourage the use of bucket policies and IAM policies for access management, which are more secure and flexible.

Here are a few approaches to resolve this issue:

Enable ACLs on the Bucket:
You can explicitly enable ACLs when you create a new bucket or modify an existing bucket. This can be done through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or by specifying it in your Terraform configuration.
To enable ACLs using Terraform, you can set the acl attribute in the aws_s3_bucket resource block. Here’s an example:
hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-bucket-name"
  acl    = "private"  # Or any other ACL setting like 'public-read', 'public-read-write', etc.
  
  # Other configurations...
}
Alternatively, you can use the AWS CLI to update the existing bucket to enable ACLs:
bash
Copy code
aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket my-bucket-name --acl private
Use Bucket Policies and IAM Policies:
If enabling ACLs does not align with your security policies or AWS best practices, consider using bucket policies and IAM roles/policies for managing access. These are generally recommended for finer-grained access control.
Here's a basic example of a bucket policy that grants read access to a specific IAM user:
json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT-ID:user/UserName"},
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
You can add this policy to your Terraform configuration under the aws_s3_bucket_policy resource.
Review AWS Documentation and Best Practices:
Since AWS periodically updates its services and practices, reviewing the most current documentation can provide insights and guidelines on how to handle these changes effectively. Make sure your strategies align with AWS's recommended best practices for security and access management.
By following these suggestions, you should be able to manage access to your S3 bucket in a way that aligns with current AWS capabilities and your organizational security requirements.

The error message "AccessControlListNotSupported" indicates the S3 bucket the user is trying to set ACLs for has ACLs disabled. This is likely due to the recent update (April 2023) by AWS where new buckets are created with the "Bucket owner enforced" setting by default, which disables ACLs.
Here are two possible solutions for the user:
Enable ACLs on the Bucket:
Access the S3 console and navigate to the bucket in question.
Go to the "Permissions" tab.
Under "Object Ownership", click "Edit".
Choose either "ObjectWriter" or "BucketOwnerPreferred" setting (these allow ACLs).
Save the changes.
Use Bucket Policies Instead of ACLs:
AWS recommends using bucket policies for access control instead of ACLs. Bucket policies are more flexible and easier to manage.
The user can define a bucket policy in their Terraform code using the aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block and aws_s3_bucket_policy resources.
These resources allow for granular control over access permissions for the bucket and its objects.
