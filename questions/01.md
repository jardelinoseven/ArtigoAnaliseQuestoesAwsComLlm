Error AccessControlListNotSupported when trying to create a bucket ACL in AWS

Recently I tried to deploy an `aws_s3_bucket_acl` resource using Terraform, and received the error:

> Error: error creating S3 bucket ACL for bucket-name: AccessControlListNotSupported: The bucket does not allow ACLs │ status code: 400

I didn't see why this wouldn't create. However I checked AWS docs [1 2] and looks like they recent had an update as of April 2023 that disabled ACLs by default.

## Highest-scored answer 

### The Problem

In the link you pasted, AWS changes something in the ACL (bucket S3) and it says the default value is ObjectWriter and to use ACL you have to set ownership to ObjectWriter or BucketOwnerPreferred" (Enable mode). If you use BucketOwnerEnforced (Disable), Terraform (ACL resource) will break.

Well, if the default is ObjectWriter, this should work to implement the ACL resource—but, with Terraform, the default value is BucketOwnerEnforced (The only one which doesn’t work for ACL).

### The Solution

If you see in Terraform that it is set to aws_s3_bucket_acl before aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls almost every time you apply, then, to avoid the error, you must change the order they are created: Set ownership to be created first, and put depends_on in the ACL resource; it will force the ownership to one value that let ACL resource be created. It will make the ownership be set to the one you want before the ACL is implemented.

### Example
```
resource "aws_s3_bucket_acl" "s3_bucket_acl" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.bucket-one-two.id
  acl    = "private"
  depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls.s3_bucket_acl_ownership]
}

# Resource to avoid error "AccessControlListNotSupported: The bucket does not allow ACLs"
resource "aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls" "s3_bucket_acl_ownership" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.bucket-one-two.id
  rule {
    object_ownership = "ObjectWriter"
  }
}
```

The error **AccessControlListNotSupported** occurs because, starting **April 2023**, Amazon S3 has **disabled ACLs (Access Control Lists) by default** for newly created buckets. Instead, AWS now recommends using **S3 Bucket Policies** and **IAM Policies** for access control.

### Possible Solutions:

#### **1. Use Bucket Policies Instead of ACLs**
Since AWS discourages ACLs, the best practice is to use **bucket policies** or **IAM roles** to manage access. Instead of using `aws_s3_bucket_acl`, define an **`aws_s3_bucket_policy`** in your Terraform code. For example:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "example" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17",
    Statement = [
      {
        Effect    = "Allow",
        Principal = "*",
        Action    = "s3:GetObject",
        Resource  = "${aws_s3_bucket.example.arn}/*"
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

#### **2. Explicitly Enable ACLs for the Bucket**
If you must use ACLs, you need to explicitly enable them by setting `object_ownership = "ObjectWriter"` in your S3 bucket resource.

Modify your Terraform configuration like this:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-example-bucket"

  object_ownership = "ObjectWriter"  # Enables ACLs
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_acl" "example" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
  acl    = "private"  # or other ACL types
}
```

#### **3. Remove ACL References in Terraform**
If you’re deploying to a **new bucket**, simply **remove** the `aws_s3_bucket_acl` resource from your Terraform configuration and rely on bucket policies instead.

---

### **Summary of the Fixes**
| Solution | When to Use |
|----------|------------|
| Use **Bucket Policies** (Recommended) | For modern access control without ACLs |
| Enable `object_ownership = "ObjectWriter"` | If you really need ACLs |
| Remove `aws_s3_bucket_acl` from Terraform | If you are using a new bucket |

## ChatGPT-4

The error message you're encountering, "AccessControlListNotSupported," suggests that the AWS S3 bucket you are attempting to configure does not support the use of Access Control Lists (ACLs). As you noted, AWS made a change in April 2023, where ACLs are disabled by default on new S3 buckets to encourage the use of bucket policies and IAM policies for access management, which are more secure and flexible.

Here are a few approaches to resolve this issue:

Enable ACLs on the Bucket:
You can explicitly enable ACLs when you create a new bucket or modify an existing bucket. This can be done through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or by specifying it in your Terraform configuration.
To enable ACLs using Terraform, you can set the acl attribute in the `aws_s3_bucket` resource block. Here’s an example:
```
hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-bucket-name"
  acl    = "private"  # Or any other ACL setting like 'public-read', 'public-read-write', etc.
  
  # Other configurations...
}
```

Alternatively, you can use the AWS CLI to update the existing bucket to enable ACLs:
```
bash
Copy code
aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket my-bucket-name --acl private
Use Bucket Policies and IAM Policies:
If enabling ACLs does not align with your security policies or AWS best practices, consider using bucket policies and IAM roles/policies for managing access. These are generally recommended for finer-grained access control.
Here's a basic example of a bucket policy that grants read access to a specific IAM user:
json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT-ID:user/UserName"},
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can add this policy to your Terraform configuration under the `aws_s3_bucket_policy` resource.
Review AWS Documentation and Best Practices:
Since AWS periodically updates its services and practices, reviewing the most current documentation can provide insights and guidelines on how to handle these changes effectively. Make sure your strategies align with AWS's recommended best practices for security and access management.
By following these suggestions, you should be able to manage access to your S3 bucket in a way that aligns with current AWS capabilities and your organizational security requirements.

You're right, the error "AccessControlListNotSupported" when trying to create an S3 bucket ACL indicates that the bucket is configured to disable Access Control Lists (ACLs) and enforce Object Ownership settings. This change, as you noted, was introduced by AWS to simplify permissions management and improve security.

Here's a breakdown of the issue and how to resolve it:

**Understanding the Problem:**

* **S3 Object Ownership:** AWS introduced S3 Object Ownership settings, which allow you to control who owns the objects in your bucket and how permissions are managed. The "Bucket owner enforced" setting, which became the default for new buckets after April 2023, disables ACLs.
* **ACLs vs. Bucket Policies:** ACLs are an older method of granting permissions, while bucket policies and IAM policies are now the recommended approach.
* **Terraform:** Your Terraform code is attempting to create an `aws_s3_bucket_acl` resource, which is incompatible with the "Bucket owner enforced" setting.

**Solutions:**

1.  **Use Bucket Policies or IAM Policies Instead of ACLs:**
    * This is the recommended approach. Instead of using `aws_s3_bucket_acl`, use `aws_s3_bucket_policy` to define your access permissions.
    * Alternatively, you can grant permissions using IAM policies attached to users, groups, or roles.
    * Bucket policies are more flexible and powerful than ACLs, allowing you to define complex access rules.
    * Example of a bucket policy in Terraform:
        ```terraform
        resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "example" {
          bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
          policy = jsonencode({
            Version = "2012-10-17",
            Statement = [
              {
                Sid    = "PublicReadGetObject",
                Effect = "Allow",
                Principal = "*",
                Action   = "s3:GetObject",
                Resource = "${aws_s3_bucket.example.arn}/*"
              },
            ]
          })
        }
        ```

2.  **Change Object Ownership (Not Recommended):**
    * You *can* change the Object Ownership setting of your bucket to "Bucket owner preferred" or "Object writer," which will re-enable ACLs. However, this is generally discouraged due to the security and simplicity advantages of "Bucket owner enforced."
    * If you absolutely must use ACLs (e.g., for compatibility with legacy systems), you can change the Object Ownership setting through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDK.
    * If the user chooses to change the object ownership, they should be made aware of the security implicatons.
    * AWS CLI example:
        ```bash
        aws s3api put-bucket-ownership-controls --bucket your-bucket-name --ownership-controls "Rules=[{ObjectOwnership=BucketOwnerPreferred}]"
        ```

3.  **Update Terraform Code:**
    * Remove the `aws_s3_bucket_acl` resource from your Terraform configuration.
    * Implement the necessary permissions using `aws_s3_bucket_policy` or IAM policies.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Security Best Practices:** AWS recommends using bucket policies and IAM policies for granular access control.
* **Simplicity:** "Bucket owner enforced" simplifies permissions management by making the bucket owner responsible for all objects.
* **Migration:** If you have existing ACLs, consider migrating them to bucket policies or IAM policies.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1.  **Verify Object Ownership:** Check the Object Ownership setting of your S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console or using the AWS CLI.
2.  **Review Terraform Code:** Ensure that you are not using `aws_s3_bucket_acl` and that you have implemented the necessary permissions using bucket policies or IAM policies.
3.  **Check AWS Documentation:** Refer to the official AWS documentation for the latest information on S3 Object Ownership and permissions management.
4.   **Test:** After implementing the changes, thoroughly test your application to ensure that access permissions are working as expected.

## DeepSeek V3

The error `AccessControlListNotSupported` indicates that the S3 bucket you're trying to configure does not allow Access Control Lists (ACLs) because ACLs have been disabled by default for new buckets as of April 2023. This change was made by AWS to encourage the use of more secure and flexible access control mechanisms, such as bucket policies and IAM policies.

Here are some possible ways to resolve this issue:

---

### 1. **Use Bucket Policies or IAM Policies Instead of ACLs**
   - AWS recommends using **bucket policies** or **IAM policies** to manage access to S3 buckets instead of ACLs. These methods provide more granular control and are more secure.
   - Update your Terraform configuration to use a `aws_s3_bucket_policy` resource instead of `aws_s3_bucket_acl`.

   Example:
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "example" {
     bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
     policy = jsonencode({
       Version = "2012-10-17"
       Statement = [
         {
           Effect    = "Allow"
           Principal = "*"
           Action    = "s3:GetObject"
           Resource  = "${aws_s3_bucket.example.arn}/*"
         }
       ]
     })
   }
   ```

---

### 2. **Enable ACLs on the Bucket (Not Recommended)**
   - If you must use ACLs for some reason, you can explicitly enable them on the bucket. However, this is not recommended unless you have a specific use case that requires ACLs.
   - To enable ACLs, set the `object_ownership` parameter to `ObjectWriter` or `BucketOwnerPreferred` and disable the `Block Public Access` settings for the bucket.

   Example Terraform configuration:
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
     bucket = "bucket-name"
   }

   resource "aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls" "example" {
     bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
     rule {
       object_ownership = "BucketOwnerPreferred"
     }
   }

   resource "aws_s3_bucket_acl" "example" {
     bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
     acl    = "private"
   }
   ```

   **Note:** Enabling ACLs may expose your bucket to unintended access if not configured carefully.

---

### 3. **Check for Existing Bucket Settings**
   - If you're working with an existing bucket, check its settings to see if ACLs are disabled. You can do this via the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or Terraform.
   - Use the AWS CLI to check the `ObjectOwnership` setting:
     ```bash
     aws s3api get-bucket-ownership-controls --bucket bucket-name
     ```
   - If the `ObjectOwnership` is set to `BucketOwnerEnforced`, ACLs are disabled. You can change it to `BucketOwnerPreferred` or `ObjectWriter` to enable ACLs.

---

### 4. **Update Terraform Provider Version**
   - Ensure you are using the latest version of the AWS Terraform provider, as older versions may not fully support the new ACL behavior.
   - Update your provider block in Terraform:
     ```hcl
     terraform {
       required_providers {
         aws = {
           source  = "hashicorp/aws"
           version = ">= 4.0.0"
         }
       }
     }
     ```

---

### 5. **Review AWS Documentation**
   - Refer to the AWS documentation for the latest updates on S3 bucket ACLs:
     - [Amazon S3 Now Automatically Enables Block Public Access and Disables ACLs for New Buckets](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/04/amazon-s3-automatically-enables-block-public-access-disables-acls-new-buckets/)
     - [Controlling Ownership of Objects and Disabling ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html)

---

### Summary
The best practice is to avoid using ACLs and instead use bucket policies or IAM policies for access control. If you must use ACLs, ensure that the bucket's `ObjectOwnership` setting allows them. Always review AWS documentation and update your Terraform configurations to align with the latest AWS features and security recommendations.


## ChatGPT-o1

Below are a few approaches that can help solve the issue. In essence, AWS has recently begun defaulting newly created buckets to **ACLs disabled** (“Bucket owner enforced”) to simplify permission management and enhance security. You’ll need to adjust either the bucket configuration or your Terraform configuration (or both):

---

### 1. Remove ACLs and rely on AWS S3 policies (Recommended)

1. **Rely on S3 bucket policies or IAM policies** rather than ACLs.  
2. In Terraform, remove the `aws_s3_bucket_acl` resource (or `acl` argument) since ACL-based permissions are disabled by default.

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-bucket-name"
  # Do not set ACLs here
}

/* Remove the aws_s3_bucket_acl block if you had it */
```

This approach keeps the “ACLs disabled” default setting, aligns with AWS best practices (least privilege + simpler access management), and avoids the `AccessControlListNotSupported` error.

---

### 2. Enable ACLs in Object Ownership settings

If you explicitly need to use S3 ACLs, you must **enable** them:

1. **In the AWS Console**: Go to your S3 bucket’s **Permissions** tab → **Object Ownership** → choose “ACLs enabled”.  
2. **Or in Terraform**: Switch the `object_ownership` argument for your S3 bucket to `"ObjectWriter"` (instead of `"BucketOwnerEnforced"`), which re-allows ACL usage.

For example:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket           = "my-bucket-name"
  object_ownership = "ObjectWriter"
}
```

*After* ensuring the bucket has ACLs enabled, you can use:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_acl" "my_acl" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket.id
  acl    = "public-read"
}
```

However, note that this is less recommended going forward. Keeping ACLs disabled is the modern best practice, relying solely on identity-based (IAM) and resource-based (bucket) policies for access control.

---

### 3. Use a pre-existing (older) bucket with ACLs enabled

If the bucket was previously created (before April 2023) and it still has “ACLs enabled,” you can continue using `aws_s3_bucket_acl`. However:

- Double-check the bucket’s “Object Ownership” setting.
- If it’s been updated (or forcibly changed by an admin/organization policy), ACLs may still be disallowed.

---

## Summary

- **Best Practice**: Avoid ACLs and remove `aws_s3_bucket_acl`. Use IAM policies for access.
- **If ACLs are needed**: Update the bucket’s **Object Ownership** to “ACLs enabled” either in the console or through Terraform (`object_ownership = "ObjectWriter"`).

This will ensure your Terraform deployments run successfully without the `AccessControlListNotSupported` error.
