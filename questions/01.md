Error AccessControlListNotSupported when trying to create a bucket ACL in AWS

Recently I tried to deploy an `aws_s3_bucket_acl` resource using Terraform, and received the error:

> Error: error creating S3 bucket ACL for bucket-name: AccessControlListNotSupported: The bucket does not allow ACLs â”‚ status code: 400

I didn't see why this wouldn't create. However I checked AWS docs [1 2] and looks like they recent had an update as of April 2023 that disabled ACLs by default.

## Highest-scored answer 

### The Problem

In the link you pasted, AWS changes something in the ACL (bucket S3) and it says the default value is ObjectWriter and to use ACL you have to set ownership to ObjectWriter or BucketOwnerPreferred" (Enable mode). If you use BucketOwnerEnforced (Disable), Terraform (ACL resource) will break.

Well, if the default is ObjectWriter, this should work to implement the ACL resourceâ€”but, with Terraform, the default value is BucketOwnerEnforced (The only one which doesnâ€™t work for ACL).

### The Solution

If you see in Terraform that it is set to aws_s3_bucket_acl before aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls almost every time you apply, then, to avoid the error, you must change the order they are created: Set ownership to be created first, and put depends_on in the ACL resource; it will force the ownership to one value that let ACL resource be created. It will make the ownership be set to the one you want before the ACL is implemented.

### Example
```
resource "aws_s3_bucket_acl" "s3_bucket_acl" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.bucket-one-two.id
  acl    = "private"
  depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls.s3_bucket_acl_ownership]
}

# Resource to avoid error "AccessControlListNotSupported: The bucket does not allow ACLs"
resource "aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls" "s3_bucket_acl_ownership" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.bucket-one-two.id
  rule {
    object_ownership = "ObjectWriter"
  }
}
```

The error **AccessControlListNotSupported** occurs because, starting **April 2023**, Amazon S3 has **disabled ACLs (Access Control Lists) by default** for newly created buckets. Instead, AWS now recommends using **S3 Bucket Policies** and **IAM Policies** for access control.

### Possible Solutions:

#### **1. Use Bucket Policies Instead of ACLs**
Since AWS discourages ACLs, the best practice is to use **bucket policies** or **IAM roles** to manage access. Instead of using `aws_s3_bucket_acl`, define an **`aws_s3_bucket_policy`** in your Terraform code. For example:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "example" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17",
    Statement = [
      {
        Effect    = "Allow",
        Principal = "*",
        Action    = "s3:GetObject",
        Resource  = "${aws_s3_bucket.example.arn}/*"
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

#### **2. Explicitly Enable ACLs for the Bucket**
If you must use ACLs, you need to explicitly enable them by setting `object_ownership = "ObjectWriter"` in your S3 bucket resource.

Modify your Terraform configuration like this:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-example-bucket"

  object_ownership = "ObjectWriter"  # Enables ACLs
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_acl" "example" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
  acl    = "private"  # or other ACL types
}
```

#### **3. Remove ACL References in Terraform**
If youâ€™re deploying to a **new bucket**, simply **remove** the `aws_s3_bucket_acl` resource from your Terraform configuration and rely on bucket policies instead.

---

### **Summary of the Fixes**
| Solution | When to Use |
|----------|------------|
| Use **Bucket Policies** (Recommended) | For modern access control without ACLs |
| Enable `object_ownership = "ObjectWriter"` | If you really need ACLs |
| Remove `aws_s3_bucket_acl` from Terraform | If you are using a new bucket |

The error message you're encountering, "AccessControlListNotSupported," suggests that the AWS S3 bucket you are attempting to configure does not support the use of Access Control Lists (ACLs). As you noted, AWS made a change in April 2023, where ACLs are disabled by default on new S3 buckets to encourage the use of bucket policies and IAM policies for access management, which are more secure and flexible.

Here are a few approaches to resolve this issue:

Enable ACLs on the Bucket:
You can explicitly enable ACLs when you create a new bucket or modify an existing bucket. This can be done through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or by specifying it in your Terraform configuration.
To enable ACLs using Terraform, you can set the acl attribute in the `aws_s3_bucket` resource block. Hereâ€™s an example:
```
hcl
Copy code
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-bucket-name"
  acl    = "private"  # Or any other ACL setting like 'public-read', 'public-read-write', etc.
  
  # Other configurations...
}
```

Alternatively, you can use the AWS CLI to update the existing bucket to enable ACLs:
```
bash
Copy code
aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket my-bucket-name --acl private
Use Bucket Policies and IAM Policies:
If enabling ACLs does not align with your security policies or AWS best practices, consider using bucket policies and IAM roles/policies for managing access. These are generally recommended for finer-grained access control.
Here's a basic example of a bucket policy that grants read access to a specific IAM user:
json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT-ID:user/UserName"},
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can add this policy to your Terraform configuration under the `aws_s3_bucket_policy` resource.
Review AWS Documentation and Best Practices:
Since AWS periodically updates its services and practices, reviewing the most current documentation can provide insights and guidelines on how to handle these changes effectively. Make sure your strategies align with AWS's recommended best practices for security and access management.
By following these suggestions, you should be able to manage access to your S3 bucket in a way that aligns with current AWS capabilities and your organizational security requirements.

The error message "AccessControlListNotSupported" indicates the S3 bucket the user is trying to set ACLs for has ACLs disabled. This is likely due to the recent update (April 2023) by AWS where new buckets are created with the "Bucket owner enforced" setting by default, which disables ACLs.

Here are two possible solutions for the user:

1. Enable ACLs on the Bucket:
   - Access the S3 console and navigate to the bucket in question.

   - Go to the "Permissions" tab.

   - Under "Object Ownership", click "Edit".

   - Choose either "ObjectWriter" or "BucketOwnerPreferred" setting (these allow ACLs).

   - Save the changes.

2. Use Bucket Policies Instead of ACLs:

   - AWS recommends using bucket policies for access control instead of ACLs. Bucket policies are more flexible and easier to manage.

   - The user can define a bucket policy in their Terraform code using the `aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block` and `aws_s3_bucket_policy resources`.

   - These resources allow for granular control over access permissions for the bucket and its objects.

Here are some additional resources that might be helpful for the user:
