## [Question 1 (Jan 2, 2024)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77744589/struggling-to-fix-referenceerror-property-readablestream-doesnt-exist)

struggling to fix: "ReferenceError: Property 'ReadableStream' doesn't exist"

I am working on a project with AWS-SDK V3, Cognito and AWS. I am struggling to setup basic functions, and keep getting errors like: ReferenceError: Property 'ReadableStream' doesn't exist. I can't find anything online, and I am questioning if this is even a good authentication approach for a scalable react native application. Has anyone dealt with this issue or know how to fix it? I am simply trying to use an "initiateauthcommand" from the V3 library, but clearly there are some compatability issues.

For context, I am using an EXPO development environment for my react native ios mobile app.

I tried using metro bundler fixes, doing pollyfilling, none of it worked. I am stumped.


## Highest-scored answer 

Ensure you've added the required polyfills for ReadableStream in your React Native Expo project. Try these imports:

import 'react-native-get-random-values';
import 'react-native-url-polyfill/auto';
import { ReadableStream } from 'web-streams-polyfill/ponyfill';
globalThis.ReadableStream = ReadableStream;

Install necessary packages:

npm install react-native-get-random-values react-native-url-polyfill web-streams-polyfill

If the issue persists, check for library updates and ensure compatibility with React Native. Consider exploring other authentication options based on your project needs.

## ChatGPT 4o

The issue you're facing—**"ReferenceError: Property 'ReadableStream' doesn't exist"**—is likely related to the fact that **React Native (especially in an Expo environment)** does not have built-in support for the `ReadableStream` API, which is part of the **Web Streams API** typically available in browsers and Node.js but not natively in React Native.

### **Possible Solutions:**
Here are a few ways you can resolve the issue:

---

### **1. Polyfill ReadableStream (Recommended)**
Since `ReadableStream` is missing in React Native, you can manually polyfill it by installing a compatible package:

#### **A. Install `react-native-polyfill-globals` (Preferred)**
```sh
npm install react-native-polyfill-globals
```
Then, add the following import at the top of your `index.js` or `App.js`:
```js
import "react-native-polyfill-globals/auto";
```

---

#### **B. Manually Polyfill ReadableStream**
If the package above does not work, you can try polyfilling `ReadableStream` directly:
```js
if (typeof global.ReadableStream === "undefined") {
  global.ReadableStream = require("web-streams-polyfill/ponyfill").ReadableStream;
}
```
Make sure to install the polyfill:
```sh
npm install web-streams-polyfill
```

---

### **2. Downgrade or Patch AWS SDK v3**
The AWS SDK v3 relies on native browser APIs, including `ReadableStream`. Since React Native does not support these APIs by default, you may need to either:

#### **A. Use AWS SDK v2 Instead**
```sh
npm uninstall @aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity-provider
npm install aws-sdk
```
Then, adjust your imports:
```js
import AWS from "aws-sdk";
```
AWS SDK v2 has broader support for React Native.

#### **B. Use AWS SDK v3 with React Native Presets**
AWS SDK v3 requires shims to work properly in React Native. You can use the following package:
```sh
npm install aws-sdk-react-native
```
And update your `metro.config.js` to ensure compatibility:
```js
const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");

const defaultConfig = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

defaultConfig.resolver.assetExts.push("cjs");

module.exports = defaultConfig;
```

---

### **3. Update Expo and React Native Version**
Ensure you're using an updated version of Expo and React Native:
```sh
expo upgrade
```
If you're using an older version of React Native, updating it might resolve compatibility issues.

---

### **4. Confirm Metro Bundler Configuration**
Metro Bundler sometimes strips out certain global objects, causing issues with dependencies like AWS SDK. Try explicitly adding support for streams by modifying `metro.config.js`:

```js
const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");

module.exports = {
  resolver: {
    extraNodeModules: {
      stream: require.resolve("stream-browserify"),
    },
  },
};
```

Then install `stream-browserify`:
```sh
npm install stream-browserify
```

---

### **Final Recommendation**
If your priority is **stability**, I recommend using **AWS SDK v2** instead of v3 for React Native, as v3 is designed primarily for Node.js and browser environments.

## Gemini

Let's break down this issue and provide a comprehensive solution for the AWS user.

**Understanding the Problem**

The core issue is the "ReferenceError: Property 'ReadableStream' doesn't exist." This indicates that the JavaScript environment where the AWS SDK v3 is running lacks the `ReadableStream` API, which is a modern web standard.

Here's why this is happening in their React Native Expo environment:

* **JavaScript Environments:**
    * React Native's JavaScript engine (typically JavaScriptCore on iOS or V8 on Android) doesn't inherently include all web APIs found in browsers.
    * `ReadableStream` is a relatively recent addition to web standards and is not always present in older JavaScript runtimes.
* **AWS SDK v3 and Streams:**
    * AWS SDK v3, especially when dealing with network requests and data transfers, might rely on `ReadableStream` for efficient handling of data.
    * When the enviroment does not support ReadableStream, the SDK will throw an error.
* **Expo and Polyfills:**
    * Expo provides a convenient development environment, but it doesn't automatically polyfill all web APIs. The user has already attempted polyfilling, but it didn't work. This means the polyfill was either implemented incorrectly or was not sufficient.

**Possible Solutions**

Here's a structured approach to solving the issue:

1.  **Verify the AWS SDK v3 Version:**
    * Ensure the user is using the latest stable version of the AWS SDK v3. Older versions might have compatibility issues.
    * Check the SDK's release notes for any known issues related to React Native or `ReadableStream`.

2.  **Explicitly Polyfill `ReadableStream`:**
    * The most likely solution is to provide a robust polyfill for `ReadableStream`.
    * **Using `web-streams-polyfill`:**
        * Install the polyfill: `npm install web-streams-polyfill` or `yarn add web-streams-polyfill`
        * Import the polyfill at the very top of the entry point of the application (e.g., `App.js` or `index.js`):
            ```javascript
            import 'web-streams-polyfill/es2018';
            ```
        * It is very important that this import be at the top of the file, so it is loaded before any other code is executed.
    * If the above polyfill doesn't work, try other polyfills related to web streams.

3.  **Check Expo and React Native Versions:**
    * Ensure the Expo and React Native versions are up-to-date. Older versions might have known compatibility issues.
    * Check the Expo documentation for any known issues related to web APIs or the AWS SDK.
    * Update expo and react native:
        * `npx expo upgrade`

4.  **Investigate AWS SDK v3 Configuration:**
    * Review the AWS SDK v3 configuration to ensure it's compatible with React Native.
    * Look for any configuration options related to streams or data handling.
    * Ensure the aws-sdk is configured to work in a browser like environment.

5.  **Alternative Authentication Approaches (Considerations):**
    * While Cognito is a powerful authentication service, the user might consider alternative approaches if compatibility issues persist.
    * **AWS Amplify:**
        * AWS Amplify is a framework specifically designed for building mobile and web applications with AWS services.
        * It provides abstractions and pre-built components that simplify authentication with Cognito.
        * Amplify might handle polyfilling and compatibility issues automatically.
        * Using amplify is the best solution for react native applications using AWS.
    * If the user is set on using the raw AWS-SDK, then the above polyfilling solutions are the best approach.

6.  **Debugging and Logging:**
    * Add extensive logging to the application to pinpoint the exact location of the error.
    * Use the React Native debugger to inspect the JavaScript environment and identify missing APIs.
    * Use console.log statements to check if the polyfill is being loaded.

**Recommendation:**

* The most likely solution is to use the `web-streams-polyfill` and import it at the very top of the application's entry point.
* If that does not work, the user should strongly consider using AWS Amplify. Amplify is designed to abstract away many of these compatability problems.

By following these steps, the user should be able to resolve the "ReferenceError: Property 'ReadableStream' doesn't exist" issue and successfully use the AWS SDK v3 in their React Native Expo application.


## Q

I understand you're facing compatibility issues with AWS SDK v3 and Cognito in your React Native application. Before we dive into troubleshooting, I'd like to check if there are any underlying AWS Cognito service issues. Could you please provide:

1. The AWS region where your Cognito user pool is located (e.g., us-east-1)
2. The approximate time window when you encountered these errors (please narrow it down to less than 30 minutes if possible)
3. Your Cognito User Pool ID (if you have it readily available)

If you're not sure about any of these details, just say "I don't know," and I'll look at all the metrics in the AWS/Cognito namespace for the last 30 minutes in your default region. After checking the service health, I can provide some suggestions to address the "ReadableStream" error in your React Native environment.


## DeepSeek R1

The `ReadableStream` error occurs because React Native's JavaScript environment lacks certain web APIs that the AWS SDK V3 might rely on. Here's how to address this:

### 1. **Polyfill `ReadableStream`**
Install a polyfill for the Streams API:
```bash
npm install web-streams-polyfill
# or
yarn add web-streams-polyfill
```

**At the top of your app entry file (e.g., `App.js`):**
```javascript
import 'web-streams-polyfill/es2018'; // Import before AWS SDK
```

### 2. **Configure Metro (React Native Bundler)**
Update `metro.config.js` to handle Node.js stream polyfills:
```javascript
// metro.config.js
const { getDefaultConfig } = require('expo/metro-config');

const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

config.resolver.extraNodeModules = {
  ...config.resolver.extraNodeModules,
  stream: require.resolve('stream-browserify'),
  util: require.resolve('util/'),
};

config.transformer.getTransformOptions = async () => ({
  transform: {
    experimentalImportSupport: false,
    inlineRequires: true,
  },
});

module.exports = config;
```

Install required polyfills:
```bash
npm install stream-browserify util
# or
yarn add stream-browserify util
```

### 3. **Use AWS Amplify Instead of SDK V3**
AWS Amplify is better optimized for React Native and handles polyfills internally:
```bash
npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/auth
# or
yarn add aws-amplify @aws-amplify/auth
```

**Configure Amplify:**
```javascript
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';
import config from './aws-exports'; // Your Cognito config

Amplify.configure(config);

// Use Auth methods directly:
import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify';

async function signIn() {
  try {
    const user = await Auth.signIn(username, password);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('Error signing in:', error);
  }
}
```

### 4. **Downgrade to AWS SDK V2 (Temporary Fix)**
If polyfills don’t work, switch to the more React Native-friendly V2:
```bash
npm install aws-sdk
# or
yarn add aws-sdk
```

**V2 Example:**
```javascript
import AWS from 'aws-sdk';

AWS.config.update({ region: 'us-east-1' });
const cognito = new AWS.CognitoIdentityServiceProvider();

cognito.initiateAuth({ /* params */ }, (err, data) => { /* ... */ });
```

### 5. **Check Expo Compatibility**
- Ensure you’re using the latest Expo SDK.
- Avoid using deprecated Expo modules that conflict with AWS SDK dependencies.

### 6. **Verify Authentication Flow**
If using `USER_SRP_AUTH`, ensure you’ve imported the correct crypto dependencies (though AWS SDK V3 typically handles this). For React Native, consider using `amazon-cognito-identity-js` (client-side library) instead of raw SDK calls.

---

### Final Notes
- **Best Path:** Use AWS Amplify for React Native apps—it abstracts low-level SDK issues.
- If polyfills fail, downgrading to AWS SDK V2 or switching to Amplify is safer.
- Ensure your Expo environment isn’t stripping polyfills (check `babel.config.js` for `preset: 'module:metro-react-native-babel-preset'`).

## ChatGPT-o1

Below are some approaches you can try in order to resolve the “ReferenceError: Property ‘ReadableStream’ doesn’t exist” issue and generally get AWS SDK v3 + Cognito working correctly within a React Native (Expo) environment:

1. **Use the official AWS Amplify libraries instead of raw AWS-SDK calls**  
   - If you only need Cognito-based authentication (user sign-up, sign-in, tokens, etc.), the easiest path is usually through [AWS Amplify’s Auth category](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/getting-started/q/platform/js/). Amplify’s Auth module wraps all of that functionality and manages compatibility issues more cleanly in React Native.
   - This also tends to be the recommended approach for scalable React Native apps since Amplify is specifically designed to smooth over many platform differences (e.g., iOS vs. Android vs. web) and the underlying AWS calls.

2. **Polyfill `ReadableStream` (if you must continue with raw AWS SDK v3)**  
   - By default, React Native’s JavaScript environment does not implement all browser APIs. AWS SDK v3’s client code may rely on `ReadableStream` for certain internals.
   - You may need a polyfill that defines `ReadableStream` on the global object. Some people have had success using packages like [web-streams-polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-streams-polyfill).  
   - You would install the polyfill and then import it as early as possible in your app (e.g., in your `App.js` or a dedicated setup file) so that `ReadableStream` is defined before any AWS libraries are loaded:
     ```js
     import 'web-streams-polyfill/ponyfill'; 
     // or whichever variant ensures `ReadableStream` is globally available
     ```
   - Note: Because React Native has its own approach to bundling (especially with Expo), you may need to experiment with the correct import path or configuration.

3. **Check your Metro bundler config**  
   - Since you mentioned already trying Metro bundler fixes and polyfills, ensure you have added any needed “resolver” or “transformer” entries in `metro.config.js` so that the polyfills are actually included.
   - For example:
     ```js
     // metro.config.js
     module.exports = {
       resolver: {
         extraNodeModules: {
           // Force certain node libs or fallback to polyfills
           stream: require.resolve('stream-browserify'),
           // or see if you need additional modules
         },
       },
     };
     ```
   - If you already tried something along those lines, double-check that your config is actually being picked up by Metro and that your polyfill import lines aren’t being stripped.

4. **Install React Native–specific shims if needed**  
   - Some Node/Web APIs (like Crypto, Buffer, events, streams, etc.) don’t exist in React Native by default. For example, `react-native-get-random-values` is needed if certain cryptographic operations are used. Similarly, you might need to import `node-libs-browser` or partial shims for stream APIs.
   - The AWS SDK v3 can bring in dependencies that expect some Node or browser runtime APIs. Check the library’s dependencies (or any sub-dependencies you import from AWS SDK v3, like `@aws-sdk/smithy-client`, etc.) and add the appropriate polyfills.

5. **Consider using AWS SDK v2 if v3 remains problematic**  
   - While AWS strongly recommends v3 for new projects, v2 historically had broader React Native usage. Some developers find it easier to set up v2 in React Native with fewer polyfill or bundler quirks. If Amplify isn’t an option for some reason and you still want raw clients, testing v2 might help isolate whether v3’s design is the culprit.
   - If you do revert to v2, remember that you won’t get some of the nice modularization v3 provides. But as a short-term fix, it can let you move forward.

6. **Verify your Expo version & environment**  
   - Some older or certain “Managed Workflow” Expo versions have quirks that require additional steps for custom native modules or polyfills. Make sure you’re on a relatively up-to-date SDK release (e.g., Expo SDK 48 or newer).
   - If you continue having trouble, consider using the Bare Workflow to gain more control over native dependencies and the build process.

---

### Summary
- **Best**: Try Amplify’s Auth category for a streamlined React Native + Cognito integration.  
- **Alternatively**: Polyfill `ReadableStream` (using e.g. `web-streams-polyfill`) and check that Metro includes it. Ensure you’ve pulled in all Node/browser shims the AWS SDK v3 depends on.  
- **Fallback**: Use AWS SDK v2 or a Bare Workflow if you can’t get the right polyfills working in Expo.

These steps generally address the missing `ReadableStream` and help you get Cognito authentication functioning properly.

If forced to choose, these two are the least distinct from the baseline but are still not inaccurate.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Final Note

All chatbots generally point to the same essential fix: a polyfill for `ReadableStream`, plus verifying compatibility and possibly switching to AWS Amplify or AWS SDK v2. The baseline specifically enumerates the exact polyfills (`react-native-get-random-values`, `react-native-url-polyfill`, and `web-streams-polyfill`) with code snippets for setting `globalThis.ReadableStream`. The chatbots’ recommendations revolve around the same principle, with minor variations in package names and configuration details.
