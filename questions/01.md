## [Question 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77744589/struggling-to-fix-referenceerror-property-readablestream-doesnt-exist)

I am working on a project with AWS-SDK V3, Cognito and AWS. I am struggling to setup basic functions, and keep getting errors like: ReferenceError: Property 'ReadableStream' doesn't exist. I can't find anything online, and I am questioning if this is even a good authentication approach for a scalable react native application. Has anyone dealt with this issue or know how to fix it? I am simply trying to use an "initiateauthcommand" from the V3 library, but clearly there are some compatability issues.

For context, I am using an EXPO development environment for my react native ios mobile app.

I tried using metro bundler fixes, doing pollyfilling, none of it worked. I am stumped.


## Highest-scored answer 

Ensure you've added the required polyfills for ReadableStream in your React Native Expo project. Try these imports:

import 'react-native-get-random-values';
import 'react-native-url-polyfill/auto';
import { ReadableStream } from 'web-streams-polyfill/ponyfill';
globalThis.ReadableStream = ReadableStream;

Install necessary packages:

npm install react-native-get-random-values react-native-url-polyfill web-streams-polyfill

If the issue persists, check for library updates and ensure compatibility with React Native. Consider exploring other authentication options based on your project needs.

## Q

I understand you're facing compatibility issues with AWS SDK v3 and Cognito in your React Native application. Before we dive into troubleshooting, I'd like to check if there are any underlying AWS Cognito service issues. Could you please provide:

1. The AWS region where your Cognito user pool is located (e.g., us-east-1)
2. The approximate time window when you encountered these errors (please narrow it down to less than 30 minutes if possible)
3. Your Cognito User Pool ID (if you have it readily available)

If you're not sure about any of these details, just say "I don't know," and I'll look at all the metrics in the AWS/Cognito namespace for the last 30 minutes in your default region. After checking the service health, I can provide some suggestions to address the "ReadableStream" error in your React Native environment.
