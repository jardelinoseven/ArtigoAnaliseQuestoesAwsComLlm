Error AccessControlListNotSupported when trying to create a bucket ACL in AWS

Recently I tried to deploy an `aws_s3_bucket_acl` resource using Terraform, and received the error:

> Error: error creating S3 bucket ACL for bucket-name: AccessControlListNotSupported: The bucket does not allow ACLs │ status code: 400

I didn't see why this wouldn't create. However I checked AWS docs [1 2] and looks like they recent had an update as of April 2023 that disabled ACLs by default.

### The Problem

In the link you pasted, AWS changes something in the ACL (bucket S3) and it says the default value is ObjectWriter and to use ACL you have to set ownership to ObjectWriter or BucketOwnerPreferred" (Enable mode). If you use BucketOwnerEnforced (Disable), Terraform (ACL resource) will break.

Well, if the default is ObjectWriter, this should work to implement the ACL resource—but, with Terraform, the default value is BucketOwnerEnforced (The only one which doesn’t work for ACL).

### The Solution

If you see in Terraform that it is set to aws_s3_bucket_acl before aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls almost every time you apply, then, to avoid the error, you must change the order they are created: Set ownership to be created first, and put depends_on in the ACL resource; it will force the ownership to one value that let ACL resource be created. It will make the ownership be set to the one you want before the ACL is implemented.

### Example
```
resource "aws_s3_bucket_acl" "s3_bucket_acl" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.bucket-one-two.id
  acl    = "private"
  depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls.s3_bucket_acl_ownership]
}

# Resource to avoid error "AccessControlListNotSupported: The bucket does not allow ACLs"
resource "aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls" "s3_bucket_acl_ownership" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.bucket-one-two.id
  rule {
    object_ownership = "ObjectWriter"
  }
}
```
