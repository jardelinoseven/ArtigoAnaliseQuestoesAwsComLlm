Read SQL from AWS Athena with Polars

I want to read from AWS Athena with polars. Is this possible? Before I used pandas:

```
import pandas as pd

pd.read_sql(SQL_STATMENT, conn)
```

I found this User Guide: https://pola-rs.github.io/polars-book/user-guide/howcani/io/read_db.html where Athena is not yet supported.

## Highest-scored answer 

The good news is that the doc that you linked isn't the full list of databases that are supported.

polars uses two database connection libraries (or engines):

1 . [connectorx](https://github.com/sfu-db/connector-x)

2 . [Apache Arrow adbc](https://arrow.apache.org/adbc/0.1.0/driver/cpp/index.html)

The bad news is that neither of those seems to support Athena. For the time being your best bet is probably to continue to use pandas for athena queries and then use pl.`from_pandas(...)`

Reading data from AWS Athena directly into a Polars DataFrame is not natively supported as of now, but you can achieve this by combining a few steps: executing the SQL query on Athena, downloading the results, and then loading them into Polars.

Here is a step-by-step solution:

1. **Run the Athena Query**: Use the `boto3` library to run the Athena query.
2. **Download the Query Results**: Save the results to a file (typically CSV).
3. **Load the Results into Polars**: Use Polars to read the CSV file.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Install Required Libraries
Make sure you have the required libraries installed:
```sh
pip install boto3 polars s3fs
```

#### 2. Running the Athena Query and Downloading Results
Use `boto3` to interact with Athena and download the results:

```python
import boto3
import time

def run_athena_query(query, database, s3_output):
    client = boto3.client('athena')
    
    response = client.start_query_execution(
        QueryString=query,
        QueryExecutionContext={'Database': database},
        ResultConfiguration={'OutputLocation': s3_output}
    )
    
    query_execution_id = response['QueryExecutionId']
    
    # Wait for the query to complete
    while True:
        response = client.get_query_execution(QueryExecutionId=query_execution_id)
        status = response['QueryExecution']['Status']['State']
        if status in ['SUCCEEDED', 'FAILED', 'CANCELLED']:
            break
        time.sleep(2)
    
    if status == 'SUCCEEDED':
        return s3_output + query_execution_id + '.csv'
    else:
        raise Exception('Athena query failed or was cancelled')

query = 'SELECT * FROM your_table LIMIT 10'
database = 'your_database'
s3_output = 's3://your-output-bucket/prefix/'

csv_path = run_athena_query(query, database, s3_output)
print('Query results saved to:', csv_path)
```

#### 3. Load the Results into Polars
Download the CSV file from S3 and load it into Polars:

```python
import polars as pl
import s3fs

# Define S3 filesystem
s3 = s3fs.S3FileSystem()

# Read the CSV file into a Polars DataFrame
def read_csv_from_s3(s3_path):
    with s3.open(s3_path, 'rb') as f:
        df = pl.read_csv(f)
    return df

# Load the CSV into a Polars DataFrame
df = read_csv_from_s3(csv_path)
print(df)
```

### Summary
1. **Run the Athena Query**: Execute the query using `boto3` and save the results to an S3 bucket.
2. **Download the Results**: Use `s3fs` to access the CSV file stored in S3.
3. **Load into Polars**: Use Polars to read the CSV file into a DataFrame.

By following these steps, you can effectively read data from AWS Athena and load it into a Polars DataFrame for further analysis.


## ChatGPT-4

Currently, Polars does not natively support reading directly from AWS Athena as it might with other databases through its `read_sql` implementation that utilizes third-party connectors like `sqlalchemy`. However, you can still work with Athena data in Polars by first fetching the data through another means and then converting it to a Polars DataFrame.

Here are some steps and a method you could use to achieve this by fetching data with `pandas` and then converting it to `Polars`:

### 1. Fetch Data with Pandas
You've already used pandas to fetch data from Athena. You can continue to use this approach to handle the SQL execution and data retrieval. Assuming you have a connection setup using `pyathena` or a similar connector:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pyathena import connect

conn = connect(s3_staging_dir='s3://your-staging-dir/',
               region_name='your-region')

sql_statement = "SELECT * FROM your_table"
df = pd.read_sql(sql_statement, conn)
```

### 2. Convert Pandas DataFrame to Polars DataFrame
Once you have the data in a pandas DataFrame, converting it to a Polars DataFrame is straightforward:

```python
import polars as pl

polars_df = pl.from_pandas(df)
```

This method leverages pandas for data fetching and Polars for data manipulation and analysis, combining the strengths of both libraries.

### 3. Direct Query Execution (Alternative Method)
If you prefer to minimize memory usage and potentially improve performance, consider executing the query and fetching the data directly into Python in a more memory-efficient format before converting it to a Polars DataFrame:

```python
from pyathena import connect
import polars as pl

conn = connect(s3_staging_dir='s3://your-staging-dir/',
               region_name='your-region')

def fetch_data(query, connection):
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute(query)
        columns = [desc[0] for desc in cursor.description]
        data = cursor.fetchall()
        return pl.DataFrame({col: [row[idx] for row in data] for idx, col in enumerate(columns)})

sql_statement = "SELECT * FROM your_table"
polars_df = fetch_data(sql_statement, conn)
```

This method directly constructs a Polars DataFrame from the fetched data, skipping the intermediate step of creating a pandas DataFrame.

### 4. Considerations and Future Updates
- **Performance**: If you are dealing with large datasets, the direct fetch method might be more efficient.
- **Functionality**: Keep an eye on updates from Polars. The library is actively developed, and direct support for additional data sources, including possibly Athena, might be added in the future.
- **Storage and Transfer Costs**: When using AWS Athena, consider the costs associated with data scan and transfer, especially if operating within tight budget constraints.

By using these methods, you can effectively integrate AWS Athena with Polars for your data processing tasks, utilizing pandas for what it's best at (data fetching) and Polars for efficient data manipulation and analysis.

You're right, Polars currently doesn't have built-in support for reading data directly from AWS Athena. The user guide you linked accurately reflects that. However, there are a couple of workarounds to achieve the desired outcome:
1. Using pyathena and Polars Integration:
pyathena: This library allows interacting with AWS Athena using Python. It retrieves data as Arrow Tables, a format compatible with Polars.
Python
import pyathena
import polars as pl

# Connect to Athena using pyathena
conn = pyathena.connect(aws_access_key_id="<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>",
                        aws_secret_access_key="<YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>",
                        region_name="<YOUR_REGION_NAME>")

# Execute SQL statement and fetch results as Arrow Table
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute(SQL_STATMENT)
arrow_table = cursor.fetch_arrow()

# Convert Arrow Table to Polars DataFrame
df = pl.from_arrow(arrow_table)

# Process the data using Polars functions
# ...

# Close the connection
conn.close()


2. Using Pandas as an Intermediate Step:
pandas.read_sql: Although Polars doesn't support Athena yet, you can leverage pandas to read the data first.
Python
import pandas as pd
import polars as pl

# Read data with pandas
df_pd = pd.read_sql(SQL_STATMENT, conn)

# Convert Pandas DataFrame to Polars DataFrame
df = pl.from_pandas(df_pd)

# Process the data using Polars functions
# ...


Choosing the Right Approach:
pyathena and Polars Integration: This offers a more native Polars experience, avoiding the pandas dependency. However, it requires additional setup for the pyathena library.
Pandas as an Intermediate Step: This is a simpler approach if you're already familiar with pandas and don't mind the extra dependency.
Additional Notes:
Ensure you have the necessary credentials configured for accessing AWS Athena.
Consider using environment variables or a secure configuration file to store your AWS credentials instead of hardcoding them in your code.
By implementing one of these workarounds, the AWS user can leverage Polars for data analysis while still querying data from AWS Athena. Remember to choose the approach that best suits their project's needs and existing dependencies.


## Q

To read from AWS Athena using the Polars library, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary Python packages:
   - `pip install pyathena polars`

2. Use the `pyathena` library to execute SQL queries on Athena and retrieve the results:

   ```python
   import polars as pl
   from pyathena import connect

   # Create a connection to Athena
   conn = connect(
       s3_staging_dir="s3://your-athena-query-results-bucket/path/to/query/results"
   )

   # Execute a SQL query and retrieve the results as a Polars DataFrame
   df = pl.scan_pandas(conn.execute("SELECT * FROM your_table"))
   ```

   In the above example, replace `"s3://your-athena-query-results-bucket/path/to/query/results"` with the appropriate S3 bucket and path where Athena stores the query results.

3. The `pl.scan_pandas()` function from Polars allows you to directly read the results of the Athena query into a Polars DataFrame, without the need to use Pandas.

Note that the Polars library is not officially supported by AWS for Athena integration, as mentioned in the Polars User Guide. However, you can use the `pyathena` library to execute Athena queries and then convert the results into a Polars DataFrame.

If you encounter any issues or have further questions, please refer to the AWS Athena documentation or the Polars documentation for more information.
