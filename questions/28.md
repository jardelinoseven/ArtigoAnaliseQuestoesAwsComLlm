## [Question 28 (Apr 24, 2024)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78375871/llama3-instruct-8b-hallucinates-even-though-i-am-using-the-correct-prompt-format)

LLAMA3 instruct 8B hallucinates even though I am using the correct prompt format

I am running `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct` endpoint on AWS and for some reason cannot get reasonable output when prompting the model. It hallucinates even when I send through a simple prompt. Could someone please advise what I am doing wrong? 

Exemplary prompt: 
```
<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>
You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. Always answer as helpfully as possible, while being safe. Your answers should not include any harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal content. 
Please ensure that your responses are socially unbiased and positive in nature.
If a question does not make any sense, or is not factually coherent, explain why instead of answering something not correct. If you don't know the answer to a question, please don't share false information.
<|eot_id|>

<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Following the logic the examples below, you need to extract the bank name from the question in the <QSTN></QSTN> tag and return bank name in the answer if there is any. 
If a question contains a misprint in the bank name, missing or excessive comma, correct it and return a corrected spelling.

Example 1 
Question: Is there children criteria for Aussie Home Loans?
Answer: Aussie Home Loans
Example 2
Question: What bank will take only 1 payslip to verify full-time PAYG income? 
Answer: none 
Example 3
Question: What part of salary income I can use for a loan with CBA?
Answer: CBA 
Example 4
Question: Can you tell me what negative gearing is? 
Answer: none 
Example 5
Question: What's St George policy on foreign residents?
Answer: St. George 
Example 6
Question: What is the max LVR for a loan with NAB?
Answer: NAB
Example 7
Question: What is Aussie policy on home loan borrowing?
Answer: Aussie Home Loans
Example 8
Question: What is LVR?
Answer: none

Your answer must only contain the bank name and nothing else. 
Primary bank names: ANZ, HSBC, CBA, Westpac, Macquarie, St. George, ING, Suncorp, Bankwest, NAB, Aussie Home Loans, Great Southern Bank, AMP, BOM, Bank Of Melbourne, BankSA, BMM, BOQ, Bank Of Queensland, Firstmac, Heritage Bank, HomeStart, Keystart, La Trobe, Liberty, ME Bank, Mystate, Newcastle Permanent, Pepper, Virgin Money.
The following names are synonyms (different naming for the primary bank names): Commonwealth Bank = CBA, WPC = Westpac, WBC = Westpac, MAC = Macquarie, Macquarie Bank = Macquarie, STG = St. George, St George = St. George, Saint George = St. George, BWS = Bankwest, GSB = Great Southern Bank, Aussie Elevate = Aussie Home Loans, Aussie Select = Aussie Home Loans, Aussie Activate = Aussie Home Loans, NAB = National Australia Bank.

When answering, remove quotes, double quotes, and any other special symbols from the answer.
If there is no bank name in the question, return 'none' (in lowercase) and do not answer the question in the <QSTN></QSTN> tag. 

Your answer could only be the bank name or 'none', and nothing else.

### **Fixing Hallucinations in `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct` on AWS Bedrock**

Your issue is that **LLama 3 (8B Instruct) is not responding properly to the structured prompt format** and **hallucinates** instead of following the expected instruction. Let's go step by step to fix this.

---

## **Potential Issues & Fixes**

### **1. Issue: Incorrect System Prompt Handling in AWS Bedrock**
Your model prompt uses **Meta’s raw token-based prompt format**, but AWS Bedrock may **not** require `<|begin_of_text|>` and other special tokens.

#### **Fix: Try Using a Simpler Prompt Format**
Remove `<|begin_of_text|>`, `<|eot_id|>`, and **only use natural instruction formatting**:
```plaintext
[System]
You are a helpful AI assistant that extracts bank names from user questions.
If the question contains a bank name, return only the name. If no bank is mentioned, return "none".
Correct minor spelling errors and remove any extra punctuation.

[User]
Does ING support foreign income?

[Assistant]
```
✅ **Why?**  
- AWS Bedrock **may not require special formatting tokens**.
- This follows the **standard Llama 3 instruct-style prompt**.

---

### **2. Issue: `return_full_text: False` May Truncate Expected Output**
The parameter:
```yaml
return_full_text: False
```
**prevents the model from including part of the original input in its response**, but sometimes this causes unexpected formatting issues.

#### **Fix: Set `return_full_text: True`**
```yaml
model_kwargs: 
    temperature: 0.001
    do_sample: True
    max_new_tokens: 50
    typical_p: 0.2
    seed: 1
    use_cache: False 
    return_full_text: True  # <--- Change this!
```
✅ **Why?**  
- Ensures that the model properly appends its response to your input **without truncating context**.

---

### **3. Issue: `do_sample: True` Enables Stochastic Responses**
Setting `do_sample: True` means the model **randomly samples responses**, leading to **inconsistent or hallucinated answers**.

#### **Fix: Use `do_sample: False`**
```yaml
model_kwargs: 
    temperature: 0.001
    do_sample: False  # <--- Force deterministic response
    max_new_tokens: 50
    typical_p: 0.2
    seed: 1
    use_cache: False 
    return_full_text: True
```
✅ **Why?**  
- Makes the model **deterministic**, ensuring **consistent responses**.

---

### **4. Issue: `max_new_tokens` is Too High (500 Tokens)**
You only expect **one or two words** as an answer (`Bank Name` or `"none"`), so **500 tokens is excessive**.

#### **Fix: Reduce `max_new_tokens` to 5-10**
```yaml
max_new_tokens: 10  # Enough for a short bank name
```
✅ **Why?**  
- Prevents the model from generating **unnecessary or verbose responses**.

---

### **5. Issue: Model Requires Few-Shot Examples for Better Accuracy**
Even though you provided examples in your prompt, **try formatting them as a proper few-shot example session**.

#### **Fix: Reformat Prompt to Few-Shot Structure**
```plaintext
[System]
You are an AI assistant that extracts bank names from user queries.

[User]
What is the max LVR for a loan with NAB?

[Assistant]
NAB

[User]
Does ING support foreign income?

[Assistant]
```
✅ **Why?**  
- Ensures the model **understands expected behavior**.

---

## **Final Recommended Fixes**
### **Updated `model_kwargs`**
```yaml
model_kwargs: 
    temperature: 0.001
    do_sample: False  
    max_new_tokens: 10  
    typical_p: 0.2
    seed: 1
    use_cache: False 
    return_full_text: True
```

### **Updated Prompt**
```plaintext
[System]
You are an AI assistant that extracts bank names from user queries.

[User]
Does ING support foreign income?

[Assistant]
```
✅ **Why This Works?**
- **Removes unnecessary special tokens** (`<|begin_of_text|>`, `<|eot_id|>`)
- **Uses deterministic response settings** (`do_sample: False`)
- **Ensures clear task definition** with **few-shot examples**
- **Reduces token generation** to **prevent hallucinations**

---

## **Final Checklist**
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Meta special tokens (`<|begin_of_text|>`) may not work in AWS Bedrock** | Use a **simpler instruct-style prompt** |
| **`do_sample: True` leads to hallucinations** | Set `do_sample: False` |
| **`max_new_tokens: 500` is too high** | Reduce to **10 tokens max** |
| **AWS Bedrock may handle `return_full_text` differently** | Set `return_full_text: True` |
| **Better prompt formatting needed** | Use **few-shot learning** for improved accuracy |

---

### **Expected Output (After Fixing)**
When you send:
```plaintext
[User]
Does ING support foreign income?

[Assistant]
```
💡 **Correct Output:**  
```plaintext
ING
```
Instead of hallucinated job search text.

After applying these fixes, your **LLama 3 Instruct model on AWS Bedrock should respond accurately**! 🚀 Let me know if you need further debugging! ✅

## Gemini

The user is experiencing hallucination issues with the Llama 3 8B Instruct model on AWS Bedrock, despite using the correct prompt format. The model is not following the instructions to extract bank names and instead generates irrelevant text.

Here's a breakdown of the problem and possible solutions:

**Understanding the Problem:**

* **Hallucination:**
    * Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes generate text that is not grounded in the provided context or instructions, a phenomenon known as hallucination.
    * Even with precise prompting, there's no guarantee of perfect accuracy.
* **Model Sensitivity:**
    * LLMs are sensitive to subtle variations in prompts. Slight changes can significantly impact output.
    * Llama 3, while powerful, is not immune to these kinds of sensitivity issues.
* **Deployment and Configuration:**
    * While the user's deployment setup seems generally correct, there might be subtle configuration issues affecting the model's behavior.
    * The model kwargs supplied are also generally correct, but may need some tweaking.
* **Prompt Complexity:**
    * Even though the prompt seems well-defined, LLMs can struggle with complex extraction tasks, especially when they involve recognizing patterns and synonyms.

**Possible Solutions:**

1.  **Simplify the Prompt:**

    * Reduce the complexity of the prompt by focusing on the core task: extracting bank names.
    * Minimize the amount of extraneous information, such as the detailed explanation of synonyms.
    * Try removing the example section, and only provide instructions. Sometimes LLMs perform better with less examples.
    * Try removing the system prompt, as sometimes it can cause issues.
    * Example simplified prompt:

    ```
    <|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
    Extract the bank name from the following question. If no bank name is present, return 'none'.
    Bank names: ANZ, HSBC, CBA, Westpac, Macquarie, St. George, ING, Suncorp, Bankwest, NAB, Aussie Home Loans, Great Southern Bank, AMP, BOM, Bank Of Melbourne, BankSA, BMM, BOQ, Bank Of Queensland, Firstmac, Heritage Bank, HomeStart, Keystart, La Trobe, Liberty, ME Bank, Mystate, Newcastle Permanent, Pepper, Virgin Money.
    Question: Does ing support foreign income?
    <|eot_id|>
    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
    ```

2.  **Adjust Model Parameters:**

    * Experiment with different values for `temperature`, `typical_p`, and `max_new_tokens`.
    * A lower `temperature` (closer to 0) can reduce randomness and make the model more deterministic.
    * A lower typical_p can also help with focusing the output.
    * Try increasing the max_new_tokens.
    * Example model kwargs:

    ```
    model_kwargs: {
        temperature: 0.01,
        max_new_tokens: 100,
        typical_p: 0.1
    }
    ```

3.  **Prompt Engineering Techniques:**

    * Use keywords and phrases that the model is likely to recognize.
    * Try different prompt variations to see which one produces the best results.
    * Try using few shot prompting, with very simple examples.
    * Try using chain of thought prompting.

4.  **Check for Deployment Issues:**

    * Verify that the model is loaded correctly and that there are no errors in the deployment logs.
    * Ensure that the correct model version is being used.
    * Try redeploying the endpoint.

5.  **Evaluate and Iterate:**

    * Thoroughly evaluate the model's output with a variety of prompts.
    * Iteratively refine the prompt and model parameters based on the evaluation results.

6.  **Use a simpler test:**

    * Try a very simple test, such as asking the model what 1+1 is. This will help determine if the model is working at all.

**Example of a very simple test:**

Prompt:

```
<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
What is 1+1?
<|eot_id|>
<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
```

By systematically trying these solutions, the user should be able to improve the model's performance and reduce hallucinations.

To resolve the hallucination issue with the Llama-3-8B-Instruct model on AWS, follow these steps:

### 1. **Fix Prompt Format**
Llama-3 requires strict adherence to its special token format. Replace `<|begin_of_text|>` with the official start token and fix the structure:

```text
<|begin_of_text|>
<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>
[Your system message here]<|eot_id|>
<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
[Your query here]<|eot_id|>
<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
```

### 2. **Simplify Instructions**
Use more explicit formatting for the extraction task:
```text
<|begin_of_text|>
<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>
You are a bank name extraction tool. Return only the corrected bank name from the question or 'none'.
<|eot_id|>
<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
Question: Does ing support foreign income?
Extract bank name using these rules:
- Primary names: ANZ, HSBC, CBA...
- Synonyms: ING = ING, ing = ING
- Return only bank name or 'none'
<|eot_id|>
<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
```

### 3. **Adjust Model Parameters**
```python
model_kwargs = {
    "temperature": 0.01,        # Lower for deterministic output
    "max_new_tokens": 15,        # Limit to short answers
    "do_sample": False,          # Disable probabilistic sampling
    "repetition_penalty": 1.2,   # Prevent rambling
    "stop_sequences": ["<|eot_id|>", "\n"]  # Force early stopping
}
```

### 4. **Add Response Constraints**
Use logit bias to restrict outputs:
```python
allowed_tokens = ["none", "ANZ", "HSBC", "CBA", ...]  # Your bank list
token_ids = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(allowed_tokens)
model_kwargs["logit_bias"] = {id: 100 for id in token_ids}
```

### 5. **Validate Deployment Configuration**
```python
hub = {
    "HF_MODEL_ID": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct",
    "HF_AUTO_CAST_TYPE": "bf16",
    "HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN": "******",
    # Add tokenizer config
    "HF_TOKENIZER_CONFIG": {
        "add_prefix_space": True,
        "use_fast": True
    }
}
```

### 6. **Test with Minimal Example**
```python
test_prompt = """<|begin_of_text|>
<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>
Return bank name or 'none'<|eot_id|>
<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
Question: Does CBA allow loans?<|eot_id|>
<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>"""
```

### Key Fixes Explained:
1. **Token Alignment**: The original prompt used incorrect delimiters (`<QSTN>` vs official `<|eot_id|>`)
2. **Output Constraints**: Short token limit + logit bias forces compliance
3. **Task Simplification**: Clearer system message reduces ambiguity
4. **Deterministic Sampling**: Disabling sampling reduces hallucinations

After implementing these changes, test with:
```python
Does ing support foreign income? → ING
What's WBC's policy? → Westpac
What is LVR? → none
```

## ChatGPT o1

Below are some key points to get Llama 3‑Instruct models to follow your “system instructions” reliably on AWS with Text Generation Inference (TGI). Right now, your prompt is using Anthropic‑style role tokens (`<|start_header_id|>system`, etc.), which Llama does not recognize. Instead, Llama (including Llama 2/3 “Instruct” variants) typically expects a **single text string** containing the system prompt and user prompt in a specific format. If you don’t use the format it was trained on, the model can ignore or misinterpret your instructions – leading to irrelevant or “hallucinated” answers.

Below is how to properly structure a system + user prompt for Llama 2 or 3–style “instruct” models:

---

## 1. Use Llama’s Chat or “Instruction” Formatting

Typically, Llama 2/3 Instruct models respond best to prompts that look something like this (using a Chat style with system + user messages in special tokens). Here’s the general pattern:

```text
<s>[INST]
<<SYS>>
{system_instructions_go_here}
<</SYS>>

{user_question_goes_here}
[/INST]
```

For a purely “system + user” prompt, you might do:

```text
<s>[INST]
<<SYS>>
You are a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant. Always answer as helpfully as possible, while being safe...
(Any other system or policy text you want the model to follow)
<</SYS>>

Following the logic of the examples, you need to extract the bank name from the question in <QSTN> tags...
When answering, remove quotes...
If no bank name, return 'none'...
[/INST]
```

Then the model (i.e. the “assistant” output) picks up from there. If you want an explicit user prompt, you can append it after the system block, e.g.:

```text
<s>[INST]
<<SYS>>
You are a helpful system...
<</SYS>>

<QSTN>Does ing support foreign income?</QSTN>
[/INST]
```

That’s it — you don’t add separate “assistant” or “system” lines with the “Anthropic style” tokens like `<|start_header_id|>assistant`. Llama expects everything in that single `[INST] ... [/INST]` block.  

---

## 2. Provide the Prompt to TGI as a Single String

On AWS with TGI, your request might look like:

```python
prompt_text = f"""<s>[INST]
<<SYS>>
You are a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant ...
(etc.)
<</SYS>>

<QSTN>Does ing support foreign income?</QSTN>
[/INST]
"""

payload = {
    "inputs": prompt_text,
    "parameters": {
        "temperature": 0.001,
        "max_new_tokens": 500,
        "do_sample": True,
        # etc.
    }
}
```

Then you `invoke_endpoint` or pass `payload` to TGI as JSON. Llama will see your system instructions + user question and (if the model is properly trained for this format) follow them more reliably.

---

## 3. Use Stop Sequences or “eos_token_id” if Desired

Sometimes you want to prevent Llama from continuing past a certain point or from repeating the system tag. You can add a `stop` array in TGI parameters:

```json
"parameters": {
  "temperature": 0.001,
  "max_new_tokens": 500,
  "stop": ["</s>"], 
  ...
}
```

This is optional, but many users find it helps the model wrap up neatly.

---

## 4. Avoid Anthropic / ChatGPT Role Tokens

At present, Llama 3 doesn’t parse tokens like `<|start_header_id|>system`, `<|start_header_id|>assistant`, `<|end_header_id|>` or `user:`. Instead, it was trained to interpret instructions given in the `[INST] ... [/INST]` block, with an optional `<<SYS>>` system block at the top.

**If** you feed it Anthropic or ChatGPT style roles, it typically just sees them as strange text. That can lead to ignoring your instructions or producing random text.

---

## 5. Keep an Eye on the Model’s Temperature / Sample Params

You’re using `temperature: 0.001`, which is extremely low. Usually that means near‐deterministic responses, but sometimes it can lead to weird partial completions or repetitive fallback text. If you want a bit of variety, you might try `temperature=0.1` or `0.2`. If you want fully deterministic, that’s fine, but note that the model might occasionally behave oddly if it gets stuck in an unexpected part of the distribution.

---

### Putting It All Together

1. **Rewrite** your “system” text into Llama’s system block.  
2. **Append** your user question or instructions after the system block, inside `[INST] ... [/INST]`.  
3. **Send** that single text to TGI via “inputs”.  
4. Possibly use `stop` sequences for clean cutoffs.

Example final prompt (abbreviated):

```text
<s>[INST]
<<SYS>>
You are a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant...
If you don't know the answer, say 'none'...
<</SYS>>

Following the logic the examples below...
<QSTN>Does ing support foreign income?</QSTN>
[/INST]
```

That should drastically reduce the hallucination and preserve the system instructions with Llama 3, giving you a direct answer like “ING” or “none” as expected.

## Analysis 

Note: The five LLMs have been anonymized in the analysis below, as follows: ChatGPT-4o is Chatbot #1, Gemini 2.0 Flash is Chatbot #2, Q is Chatbot #3, DeepSeek R1 is Chatbot #4 and ChatGPT-o1 is Chatbot #5

Below is an evaluation of **five different chatbot responses** to the question on why **LLAMA3 instruct 8B** on AWS is hallucinating, even though the user is following the (seemingly) correct prompt format. We compare each response to the **baseline** solution:

> **Baseline**: “The problem was solved by removing `<|end_of_text|>` from the prompt and adding `stop=["<|eot_id|>"]` in `model_kwargs`.”

---
## 1. Chatbot Response #1

**Summary of Chatbot Response #1:**  
It suggests removing `<|begin_of_text|>`, `<|eot_id|>`, etc. and using a simpler prompt format, with a few-shot approach. It also recommends adjusting model settings (e.g., turning off sampling, limiting max tokens). The solution is basically that the system tokens might be confusing the model, so it instructs to rely on plain text instructions, possibly some small examples.

### a. Accuracy
- **Pros**: The response is consistent about Llama’s known instructions for different prompt tokens, acknowledges that extraneous tokens can cause confusion. Recommends turning off sampling to reduce hallucination.  
- **Cons**: It specifically instructs removing *all* special tokens, but the baseline specifically said to remove `<|end_of_text|>` while retaining `stop=["<|eot_id|>"]`. Chatbot #1 does not mention adding `stop=["<|eot_id|>"]`, which is the direct solution from the baseline.  
**Rating**: *Partially Satisfactory.* It’s mostly correct that extra tokens cause confusion, but it doesn’t highlight the exact fix from the baseline.

### b. Completeness
- **Pros**: Mentions using a simpler prompt, changing do_sample, etc.  
- **Missing**: Doesn’t specifically mention that the user might need to add `stop=["<|eot_id|>"]` to keep the model from running on.  
**Rating**: *Partially Satisfactory.* Has good steps but misses the key “stop” part from the baseline.

### c. Clarity
- The suggestions are fairly structured and easy to follow.  
**Rating**: *Satisfactory.* It’s well-organized.

### d. Practicality
- The suggestions about removing system tokens or ignoring them are feasible. Setting do_sample to false is easy. However, it does not precisely match the “just remove `<|end_of_text|>` plus `stop=["<|eot_id|>"]`.” Instead, it suggests a bigger rewrite.  
**Rating**: *Partially Satisfactory.* The steps might indeed help, but it doesn’t directly replicate the baseline’s simpler final solution.

### **Overall Rating (Chatbot #1)**
**Partially Satisfactory** overall. Good advice on prompting & parameter changes, but does not match the baseline exactly about removing `<|end_of_text|>` and adding `stop=[“<|eot_id|>”]`.

---

## 2. Chatbot Response #2

**Summary of Chatbot Response #2:**  
Recommends removing or simplifying the system prompt, adjusting temperature, re-checking token usage, etc. The focus is on “try fewer examples,” “try removing the system prompt,” “maybe remove the synonyms.” More of general “prompt engineering” tips than a direct fix.

### a. Accuracy
- The suggestions are not contradictory, but they do not mention the baseline’s specific fix (removing `<|end_of_text|>` token and adding a stop).  
- They talk about typical ways to reduce hallucinations (changing temperature, removing synonyms).  
**Rating**: *Partially Satisfactory.* It does not address the exact cause (the special tokens interfering with the model’s text).

### b. Completeness
- They do not mention the unique line from the baseline about specifying a `stop` array with `<|eot_id|>`.  
- They also do not highlight removing `<|end_of_text|>` from the prompt.  
**Rating**: *Unsatisfactory* in terms of matching the baseline solution.

### c. Clarity
- The explanation is fairly straightforward, but more general.  
**Rating**: *Satisfactory.* The language is easy to follow.

### d. Practicality
- The suggestions are somewhat scattered, so it’s not as direct or pointed as the baseline fix.  
- It might help reduce hallucination but doesn’t directly solve the user’s immediate token-based issue.  
**Rating**: *Partially Satisfactory.*  

### **Overall Rating (Chatbot #2)**
**Partially Satisfactory**—the general guidance is not incorrect, but it doesn’t incorporate the baseline’s specific mention about removing `<|end_of_text|>` and using a `stop` param. Lacks that key detail.

---

## 3. Chatbot Response #3

**This response is missing** as the user says the maximum character count is reached. It's presumably truncated. So we skip it.

(If the truncated response is effectively non-existent, it is presumably **unsatisfactory** across all criteria.)

---

## 4. Chatbot Response #4

**Summary of Chatbot Response #4:**  
Advises removing special tokens (`<|begin_of_text|>`, `<|eot_id|>`), switching to a single `[INST]` style, adjusting the model for a Llama 2 style approach. Recommends do_sample false, a short max_new_tokens, etc. Mentions to remove user’s special tokens and use a simpler prompt approach.

### a. Accuracy
- The user’s question is about Llama 3 (Instruct) specifically on AWS. The baseline fix: remove `<|end_of_text|>` and add `stop=["<|eot_id|>"]`. Response #4, instead, references typical Llama 2 approach with `[INST] ... [/INST]`. This is relevant to Llama 2 or Llama 3, but the baseline is more minimal.  
**Rating**: *Satisfactory.* It is correct that Llama 3 might prefer an “inst” or “system block” approach. The details are accurate for Llama family.  

### b. Completeness
- Doesn’t mention `stop=["<|eot_id|>"]`, but it does mention adding a “stop sequences” or `stop: ["</s>"]`. So it’s close to the baseline’s concept of using a stop token, though not exactly `<|eot_id|>`.  
**Rating**: *Partially Satisfactory.* They do mention using a stop sequence, but not the exact approach from the baseline.  

### c. Clarity
- The instructions are quite structured.  
**Rating**: *Satisfactory.*  

### d. Practicality
- The approach is feasible, but a bit more complex than just “remove `<|end_of_text|>` and add a stop sequence.” Instead, it recommends an entire `[INST] ... [/INST]` style. This can work, but it’s more “standard Llama 2 prompt approach.”  
**Rating**: *Satisfactory.*  

### **Overall Rating (Chatbot #4)**
**Partially Satisfactory**—It is a valid approach, but not exactly the baseline fix. Good detail, but missing the exact mention of `<|eot_id|>`.

---

## 5. Chatbot Response #5

**Summary of Chatbot Response #5:**  
It says that Llama 3 is not truly aligned with the Anthropic tokens. Then it proceeds to show how to use the `[INST]` block with `<</SYS>>` etc. The final key is to unify system instructions and user content into a single text with the `[INST] ... [/INST]` style. This is fairly standard for Llama 2 or 3. 

### a. Accuracy
- This is indeed the recommended approach from official Llama docs for system + user instructions. It does not mention the *explicit* fix from the baseline about removing `<|end_of_text|>` and adding a `stop=["<|eot_id|>"]`.  
- The approach is correct for meta-llama usage though.  
**Rating**: *Satisfactory.*  

### b. Completeness
- It provides a thorough explanation. But again, the user’s question mentions an immediate fix: removing `<|end_of_text|>` from the prompt and adding `stop=["<|eot_id|>"]`. Chatbot #5 does not explicitly mention or confirm that approach.  
**Rating**: *Partially Satisfactory.*  

### c. Clarity
- The explanation about the `[INST]` block is quite detailed and clear.  
**Rating**: *Satisfactory.*  

### d. Practicality
- This approach might fix the hallucinations. But it differs from the baseline’s minimal tweak.  
**Rating**: *Partially Satisfactory.*  

### **Overall Rating (Chatbot #5)**
**Partially Satisfactory**—it’s giving a recommended approach for Llama, but not the baseline’s direct solution.

# Summary of Evaluations

Below is how each chatbot response compares with the **baseline** solution, which specifically states:

>**“The problem was solved by removing `<|end_of_text|>` from the prompt and adding `stop=["<|eot_id|>"]` in model_kwargs.”**

### Accuracy
- **Response #1**: Partially matches the baseline’s logic but doesn’t mention the exact `stop=["<|eot_id|>"]`. (Partially Satisfactory)
- **Response #2**: Very general prompt engineering advice, no mention of the baseline’s solution. (Partially Satisfactory)
- **Response #3**: Missing/Truncated. (Unsatisfactory)
- **Response #4**: Recommends a Llama 2 style approach. Good but doesn’t mention the exact `<|eot_id|>` stop. (Satisfactory/Partial)
- **Response #5**: Provides the `[INST]` approach. Not the baseline’s direct fix. (Satisfactory/Partial)

### Completeness
- **Response #1**: Good coverage but missing the exact mention of `stop=["<|eot_id|>"]`. (Partial)
- **Response #2**: Misses essential detail of removing `<|end_of_text|>` or adding a `stop`. (Partial)
- **Response #3**: Not available. (Unsatisfactory)
- **Response #4**: Mentions a stop param but not exactly `<|eot_id|>`. (Partial)
- **Response #5**: Detailed on how Llama is typically prompted, but not the baseline’s recommended fix. (Partial)

### Clarity
- Most of them are fairly coherent except #3 is truncated. So for #1, #2, #4, #5, we consider them “Satisfactory” in clarity, #3 is “Unsatisfactory.”

### Practicality
- **#1**: Recommends typical modifications, might help. (Partial)
- **#2**: Too general. (Partial)
- **#3**: No content. (Unsatisfactory)
- **#4**: Clear instructions, somewhat bigger approach than the baseline. (Satisfactory)
- **#5**: Also an extensive approach. (Satisfactory/Partial)

### Overall Best Response
- All are partial or missing the exact solution from the baseline. However, #1 and #4 or #5 arguably have the strongest, most relevant suggestions. #4 and #5 are quite detailed on correct Llama usage. 
**Thus #4 or #5** might be “best overall” in terms of detail and correctness for a Llama user, even though they do not exactly match the baseline’s short mention about removing `<|end_of_text|>` and using `stop=["<|eot_id|>"]`.

### Overall Worst Response
- **Response #3** is truncated/empty, so that’s presumably the worst.

## Final Answer

Below is a short, final summary:

1. **Chatbot #1**: Partially Satisfactory across all. Good general advice, doesn’t mention `stop=["<|eot_id|>"]`.
2. **Chatbot #2**: Also partially satisfactory, general prompt engineering tips but missing key baseline details.
3. **Chatbot #3**: Unsatisfactory (truncated / no content).
4. **Chatbot #4**: Satisfactory clarity, partial completeness; doesn’t mention the exact fix from baseline, but offers a thorough Llama approach with possible “stop” usage.
5. **Chatbot #5**: Satisfactory clarity with a well-known Llama “INST” approach; again partial completeness vs. baseline. 

**Best Response:** #4 or #5 are best in terms of detail.  
**Worst Response:** #3 is worst, as it’s truncated.
