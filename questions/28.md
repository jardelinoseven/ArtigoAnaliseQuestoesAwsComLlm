Connecting Route 53 to EC2 and port

I'm having trouble connecting Route 53 to an EC2 with an app running on the 8080 port. Currently, I can hit and use the app using `http://<EC2 name>:8080/<endpoint path>`, but I obviously want to hit it with a domain name instead.

I created a host zone .com, created a record, used record type A and set the ip as the ipv 4 provided by the EC2. I then copied the four ns- route traffic names across to the nameservers in registered domain. Unfortunately, when I hit `www.<domain name>/<endpoint path>` I get 'did not match any documents'.

Is this something I'm missing when setting up the route 53 or is it an issue to do with the port?

Any help would be gratefully received.

>but I obviously want to hit it with a domain name instead

You `can't` do that with Route53, as R53 is just a DNS resolver: domain name -> IP address (not port).

You have to do redirection of port 80 to 8080 on your `instance`, not on Route53. A common way is through `Nginx` that you have to setup and configure on the instance as a reverse proxy.

To resolve the issue of connecting Route 53 to an EC2 instance with an app running on port 8080, you should follow these steps and check for common misconfigurations:

1. **DNS Configuration:**
   - Ensure that your domain is correctly pointing to the Route 53 nameservers. Verify that the NS records in your domain registrar's settings match the NS records in your Route 53 hosted zone.
   - Ensure you have an A record in your Route 53 hosted zone that points to the public IPv4 address of your EC2 instance. This seems to be already done based on your description.

2. **Security Groups and Network ACLs:**
   - Check the security group attached to your EC2 instance. Ensure it allows inbound traffic on port 8080 from your IP or from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) if you want it to be accessible publicly.
   - Verify that any Network ACLs (NACLs) associated with your subnet are not blocking traffic on port 8080.

3. **Web Server Configuration:**
   - Ensure your web server (or application) running on the EC2 instance is configured to listen on port 8080 and respond to requests.
   - Ensure there is no firewall running on your EC2 instance that is blocking incoming traffic on port 8080.

4. **Nginx or Apache Proxy (Optional but Recommended):**
   - It’s a common practice to use a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Apache) to forward traffic from port 80 (default HTTP port) to port 8080. This way, users do not need to specify the port in the URL.
   - Example Nginx configuration:
     ```nginx
     server {
         listen 80;
         server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;

         location / {
             proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
             proxy_set_header Host $host;
             proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
             proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
             proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
         }
     }
     ```
   - This configuration will allow you to access your app using `http://yourdomain.com` without specifying port 8080.

5. **Route 53 Routing Policy:**
   - Double-check the routing policy in Route 53. If you have created a simple A record, ensure it's not associated with a weighted, latency, or geolocation-based routing policy that might be causing issues.

6. **Clearing DNS Cache:**
   - After making changes to your DNS settings, it might take some time to propagate. You can clear your local DNS cache or wait for the changes to propagate fully. You can also use tools like `dig` or `nslookup` to verify DNS propagation.

7. **Testing and Verification:**
   - Use tools like `curl` or a web browser to test accessing your application. Use the domain name to see if the traffic is properly routed and reaches your EC2 instance.

By following these steps, you should be able to properly configure Route 53 to route traffic to your EC2 instance running the app on port 8080. If issues persist, reviewing logs from your web server, Route 53, and the security group settings can provide additional insights into what might be going wrong.


## ChatGPT-4

The issue you're facing when trying to connect Route 53 to an EC2 instance where your app runs on port 8080 involves several components, including DNS configuration, server setup, and potentially firewall rules. Here’s a step-by-step approach to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. **Verify DNS Configuration in Route 53:**
   - Ensure that the A record you created in the Route 53 hosted zone correctly points to the public IPv4 address of your EC2 instance.
   - Confirm that the domain's nameservers are set to the ones provided by Route 53. It can take some time (up to 48 hours) for DNS changes to propagate fully.

2. **Check EC2 Security Group Rules:**
   - Verify that your EC2 instance’s security group allows inbound traffic on port 8080. You should have an inbound rule that looks like this:
     - **Type:** Custom TCP
     - **Protocol:** TCP
     - **Port Range:** 8080
     - **Source:** 0.0.0.0/0 (or more restrictively, your specific IP if you want to limit access)

3. **Web Server Configuration:**
   - Ensure that your application or web server running on the EC2 instance is configured to listen on port 8080 and is bound to the correct network interface (e.g., 0.0.0.0 or the public IP).

4. **Test the Connection:**
   - Directly access the EC2 instance via its IP and port (e.g., http://<EC2-public-IP>:8080) to confirm the application responds correctly. If this doesn't work, the issue could be with your application's configuration or firewall settings on the EC2 instance.

5. **Handling Port 8080 in the URL:**
   - DNS and Route 53 will not manage port forwarding. If your application runs on port 8080, you need to specify it in the URL when accessing via the domain, like this: `http://www.<domain-name>:8080/<endpoint-path>`.
   - If you want to access your application without specifying port 8080 in the URL, you will need to set up a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Apache) on your EC2 instance that listens on port 80 (the default HTTP port) and forwards requests to port 8080.

6. **Clear DNS Cache:**
   - After making DNS changes, clear your DNS cache or try accessing the domain from a different device to avoid local caching issues.

By following these steps, you should be able to diagnose where the problem lies and make the necessary adjustments to access your application via the domain name without specifying the port in the URL. If you still face issues, checking the application logs and the web server logs might provide further insights into what might be going wrong.

Understanding the Issue: Route 53, EC2, and Port 8080
The core problem: Route 53 resolves domain names to IP addresses, but it doesn't handle port numbers.
Your current setup:
EC2 instance running an app on port 8080.
Route 53 A record pointing to the EC2's public IP.
Why it's not working: When you access www.<domain name>/<endpoint path>, the browser sends a request to port 80 (default HTTP port) of the EC2 instance, not port 8080 where your app is listening.
Solutions
Option 1: Configure a Load Balancer
Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB): This is the most common and recommended solution.
Configure the ALB to listen on port 80 (HTTP) and forward traffic to your EC2 instance on port 8080.
Create an A record in Route 53 pointing to the ALB's DNS name.
Option 2: Use a Reverse Proxy
Install a reverse proxy on your EC2 instance: Tools like Nginx or Apache can be used.
Configure the reverse proxy to listen on port 80 and forward requests to your application on port 8080.
Option 3: Use a Tunnel (Less common)
Set up a tunnel: Tools like SSH tunneling can be used, but this is generally less secure and efficient.
Additional Considerations
Security Groups: Ensure your EC2 security group allows inbound traffic on port 80 (or the port your load balancer or reverse proxy listens on).
DNS Propagation: It might take some time for DNS changes to propagate globally.
Health Checks: Implement health checks for your load balancer or EC2 instance to ensure availability.
Example Nginx configuration:
Nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name www.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
    }
}


By following these steps and considering the additional points, you should be able to successfully connect your Route 53 domain to your EC2 instance and access your application on port 8080.
