How to remove a permission set for a User in IAM Identity Center

I have a highly multi-account environment and Users that are assigned multiple permission sets per account.

e.g. Bob has both Administrator and ReadOnly for Test and Prod accounts. Say I want to only remove Bob's Administrator access for the Prod account, but leave his ReadOnly permission and also leave the both the Administrator and ReadOnly permission sets intact (because Alice is still an Administrator in Prod).

How do I do this in IAM Identity Center? The only options seem to be to delete the permission set or disable/delete the user. I don't see how to remove a permission set from a user for a specific account.

## Highest-scored answer 

I learned that there is no "bulk remove" like there is for adding account permissions. You have to remove the permissions one account at a time.

- Navigate to the IAM Identity Center console and under "Multi-Account Permissions" on the left hand side, select "AWS Accounts"
- Click on the desired account link, rather than the checkbox to the left.
- Once in the individual account, under the "Users and Groups" tabs, you would see the users and groups for this account.
- Select the radial button next to the username or group and click on the "Change Permission Sets" button towards the right side of the screen.
- From this page you can then uncheck the desired permission permission set and click "Save Changes".
A bit tedious for multiple accounts, but at least it's possible.

To remove a specific permission set from a user for a particular account in AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS Single Sign-On), you need to follow these steps:

### Steps to Remove a Permission Set for a User in IAM Identity Center

1. **Access IAM Identity Center**:
   - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to **IAM Identity Center**.

2. **Manage Access for the User**:
   - In the IAM Identity Center console, go to **Users**.
   - Find and select the user for whom you want to modify the permissions (e.g., Bob).

3. **Edit Assignments**:
   - Under the **User details** section, select **Assigned accounts**.
   - You will see a list of accounts that the user has access to, along with the permission sets assigned for each account.

4. **Remove Specific Permission Set**:
   - Find the account from which you want to remove the permission set (e.g., Prod account).
   - Next to the account, there should be an option to **Edit** or **Manage assignments**.
   - In the edit assignment page, you will see the permission sets assigned to the user for that account.
   - Uncheck or remove the **Administrator** permission set while keeping the **ReadOnly** permission set checked.

5. **Save Changes**:
   - After modifying the assignments, save the changes.
   - This will update the user's permissions, removing the Administrator access for the Prod account while leaving other permissions intact.

### Detailed Instructions

Here’s a more detailed walkthrough with additional context:

1. **Navigate to IAM Identity Center**:
   - Open the AWS Management Console.
   - In the navigation pane, choose **IAM Identity Center**.

2. **Select Users**:
   - In the left pane, choose **Users**.
   - Locate and select the user (Bob).

3. **Modify Account Assignments**:
   - Click on the user’s name to open the user details.
   - Scroll down to the **Assigned accounts** section.
   - Locate the account (Prod) from which you want to remove the specific permission set.

4. **Edit Permission Sets**:
   - Next to the account name, there should be an **Edit** button or a similar option to manage assignments.
   - Click on **Edit** to open the permission set assignments for that account.
   - You will see a list of permission sets currently assigned to the user for that account.
   - Uncheck or remove the **Administrator** permission set.
   - Ensure that the **ReadOnly** permission set remains assigned.

5. **Save and Apply Changes**:
   - Click **Save** or **Apply** to confirm the changes.
   - The user will now only have the **ReadOnly** permission set for the Prod account.

### Verification

To ensure the changes have been applied correctly:
- Go back to the **Users** section in IAM Identity Center.
- Select the user and review their assigned accounts and permission sets to verify that the changes reflect what you intended.

By following these steps, you can remove a specific permission set from a user for a specific account without affecting other permission sets or users.

In AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), you can't directly remove specific permissions within a permission set assigned to a user. However, you can achieve the desired outcome by using IAM policies effectively. Here's how you can approach this:

1. **Create a Custom Policy**: Instead of directly assigning permission sets to users, create custom IAM policies that define the permissions you want users to have. This approach offers more flexibility and granularity in managing permissions.

2. **Define Separate Policies for Administrator and ReadOnly Access**: Create two separate policies, one for Administrator access and another for ReadOnly access. Each policy should contain the permissions required for the respective level of access.

3. **Attach Policies to Users**: Instead of assigning permission sets directly, attach the custom policies to users. This allows you to control which permissions each user has across different accounts.

4. **Modify Policy for Bob's Administrator Access**: If you want to remove Bob's Administrator access for the Prod account while retaining his ReadOnly access, modify the policy attached to Bob accordingly. Simply remove the permissions related to Administrator access for the Prod account from Bob's policy.

5. **Leave the Permission Sets Intact**: Since you're managing permissions through policies rather than permission sets, you don't need to delete or disable any permission sets. Both Administrator and ReadOnly permission sets can remain intact for other users who require them.

By following this approach, you can precisely control the permissions granted to users across different accounts without needing to delete or disable permission sets. Additionally, it offers greater flexibility in managing permissions as your environment evolves and user roles change.

You're right; removing a permission set from a user for a specific IAM Identity Center (IAM IC) account requires a multi-step approach. Here's how the AWS user can achieve the desired outcome:
Steps to Remove Specific Permission Set:
Identify Permission Set ARN:
In the IAM Identity Center console, navigate to the "Permission sets" section.
Locate the permission set you want to remove from Bob for the Prod account (e.g., Administrator).
Copy the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the permission set.
Modify User Permissions (Prod Account):
Go to the "AWS accounts" section in IAM Identity Center.
Select the Prod account from the list.
Click on "Users" and then locate the user "Bob."
Click on "Change Permission Sets" for Bob in the Prod account.
Exclude Permission Set in User Associations:
Deselect the checkbox next to the permission set ARN you copied in step 1 (e.g., Administrator).
Ensure the ReadOnly permission set (if applicable) remains selected.
Click "Save Changes."
Explanation:
By deselecting the specific permission set ARN in the user association for the Prod account, you effectively remove that permission set for Bob in that particular account. However, the permission set itself remains intact for potential use by other users in other accounts.
Additional Notes:
This process can be repeated for other users and accounts to fine-tune permission assignments.
Consider using IAM Identity Center policies to manage permissions across multiple accounts for a more centralized approach.
By following these steps, the AWS user can remove Bob's Administrator access for the Prod account while maintaining his ReadOnly access and preserving the permission sets themselves for potential future use.
