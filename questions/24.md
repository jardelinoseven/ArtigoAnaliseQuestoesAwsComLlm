## [Question 24](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77023991/aws-lambda-python-3-11-cannot-import-lxml-libxslt-so-1-cannot-open-shared-obj)

AWS Lambda Python 3.11: Cannot import lxml: libxslt.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I have a Python function on AWS Lambda that depends on lxml. The dependent layer includes the result of poetry install lxml, yet I receive the following error at runtime:

```
  "errorMessage": "Unable to import module 'app.dim.application.watchdog': libxslt.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory",
```
I have checked the Python 3.11 base image, and it doesn't include `libxslt.so.1`:

`docker run -ti --rm --entrypoint bash public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.11`

How can I include all shared libraries that packages, like `lxml`, depend on? Can I say to `pip` or `poetry` that they should include them in the installed package? It's a nightmare to selectively copy each shared library into a layer.

__Runtime__: Python 3.11

__Architecture__: ARM64

## Highest-scored answer 

I've just spent a day on this and I've tried all the suggestions I could find online, including:

- building in an EC2 image
- downloading binary packages like suggested by @bbayles
- using the CDK alpha for Python

None of that works, as none of those solutions will include the shared libraries. The problem is not quite in lxml, but in the fact that it has a dependency on `libxml2` and `libxslt`, which are often available in other distributions but not in the Amazon Linux distributions that back lambdas. It cannot be solved by pip, because those libraries are not under pip's control.

The one thing that DOES work is building your own Docker image for the lambda, which includes all needed packages.

A good starting point is [AWS's doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-image.html#python-image-instructions) on using container images, but see below for an easier option to build and deploy.

Assuming this directory structure:

```
build_dir
|Dockerfile
|requirements.txt
|src
   |lambda.py
```

Dockerfile:
```
FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.11-arm64
RUN yum -y upgrade
RUN yum -y install python3.11 python3-pip gcc python-devel libxml2-devel libxslt-devel

COPY requirements.txt ${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt    
COPY src ${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}
CMD [ "lambda.handler" ]
```

Note that you want to ensure that `src` is properly local to the working directory and not a symlink. See this: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy

requirements.txt. Make sure to add any other packages you will need:

```lxml```

lambda.py:

```
import json
import lxml.etree as etree

def handler(event, context):
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps('Hello from LXML!')
    }
```

You need to build the image and deploy the lambda from there. You can follow the instructions linked above, but if you are using CDK it's much simpler:

within cdk.ts

```
const fn = new cdk.aws_lambda.DockerImageFunction(this, "DockerLambda", {
    // Point to the directory where you have Dockerfile
    code: cdk.aws_lambda.DockerImageCode.fromImageAsset("build_dir"),
    // This should not be needed, but there are some issues on mac M1
    architecture: Architecture.ARM_64,
});
```

When you deploy the stack, this will do all the magic: build the image, upload it to a registry, and deploy the lambda.

To resolve the issue of missing shared libraries for `lxml` in your AWS Lambda function using Python 3.11, you can create a custom Lambda layer that includes all the necessary dependencies. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

### Step 1: Create a Lambda Layer with Dependencies

1. **Set Up a Local Environment**: Use Docker to create a local environment that matches the AWS Lambda runtime environment.

```sh
mkdir lambda-layer
cd lambda-layer
mkdir python
```

2. **Create a `requirements.txt` File**: Add `lxml` to your `requirements.txt`.

```sh
echo "lxml" > requirements.txt
```

3. **Use Docker to Install Dependencies**: Use a Docker container that matches the AWS Lambda environment to install `lxml` and its dependencies.

```sh
docker run -v $(pwd):/var/task -w /var/task lambci/lambda:build-python3.11 pip install -r requirements.txt -t python/
```

This command mounts your current directory to `/var/task` in the Docker container and installs the dependencies into the `python` directory.

4. **Zip the Layer**:

```sh
zip -r9 lambda_layer.zip python
```

### Step 2: Deploy the Lambda Layer

1. **Upload the Layer to AWS**: You can use the AWS CLI to upload the layer.

```sh
aws lambda publish-layer-version --layer-name lxml --zip-file fileb://lambda_layer.zip --compatible-runtimes python3.11 --compatible-architectures arm64
```

This command creates a new Lambda layer version and makes it compatible with Python 3.11 and the ARM64 architecture.

### Step 3: Update Your Lambda Function to Use the Layer

1. **Add the Layer to Your Lambda Function**: You can do this through the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.

Using the AWS CLI:

```sh
aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name <your-lambda-function-name> --layers <layer-arn>
```

Replace `<your-lambda-function-name>` with the name of your Lambda function and `<layer-arn>` with the ARN of the layer you just created.

### Step 4: Verify the Setup

Deploy your Lambda function and test it to ensure that the `lxml` dependency is correctly resolved and the function runs without errors.

### Summary

By creating a custom Lambda layer that includes `lxml` and its dependencies, you can resolve the issue of missing shared libraries. Using Docker ensures that the environment matches the AWS Lambda runtime, avoiding compatibility issues. This approach simplifies the process of managing dependencies and makes your Lambda function portable and easier to maintain.


## ChatGPT-4

The issue you're encountering with the `lxml` library in AWS Lambda stems from missing native dependencies (`libxslt.so.1` and likely `libxml2.so.2`) that are required by `lxml` but not included in the standard Lambda environment. Since `pip` and `poetry` manage Python packages and not their non-Python dependencies, you'll need to ensure that these libraries are packaged along with your Lambda deployment.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to solve this issue:

### 1. Create a Custom Lambda Layer
Since you're already using `poetry` to manage Python dependencies, you'll need to create a Lambda layer that includes both the `lxml` Python package and its native libraries (`libxml2` and `libxslt`). Here's how to do this:

#### Step 1: Build the Libraries
You can use an Amazon Linux 2 environment (EC2 instance or a Docker container) that matches the Lambda execution environment to build these libraries. This ensures compatibility.

- **Start an Amazon Linux 2 Container:**
  ```bash
  docker run -it --rm amazonlinux:2 bash
  ```

- **Install Necessary Tools and Libraries:**
  ```bash
  yum install -y gcc libxml2-devel libxslt-devel python3-devel
  ```

- **Install `lxml` Using `pip`:**
  ```bash
  pip install lxml -t /path/to/layer/python/lib/python3.11/site-packages/
  ```

#### Step 2: Copy the Required Libraries
You need to find and copy the shared libraries `libxml2` and `libxslt` into the layer.

- **Locate the Libraries:**
  ```bash
  find /usr -name "libxslt.so.1*"
  find /usr -name "libxml2.so.2*"
  ```

- **Copy the Libraries to the Layer Directory:**
  ```bash
  cp /usr/lib64/libxslt.so.1 /path/to/layer/lib/
  cp /usr/lib64/libxml2.so.2 /path/to/layer/lib/
  ```

#### Step 3: Package and Upload the Layer
- **Create a ZIP Archive of Your Layer:**
  ```bash
  cd /path/to/layer
  zip -r my-custom-layer.zip .
  ```

- **Upload the Layer to AWS Lambda:**
  Use AWS CLI or AWS Management Console to create a new Lambda layer with the ZIP file.

### 2. Configure Your Lambda Function
- **Attach the Layer to Your Lambda Function:**
  Make sure to include the layer in your Lambda function configuration.

- **Set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:**
  Lambda needs to know where to look for your native libraries. You can set the environment variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include `/opt/lib` in your Lambda function configuration.

### 3. Deploy and Test
Deploy your Lambda function with this new configuration and test it to ensure that the `lxml` import error is resolved.

### Conclusion
Creating a custom layer with all dependencies is a reliable way to handle complex Python packages in AWS Lambda, especially those that require specific native libraries. This method ensures that your deployment is self-contained and compatible with the AWS Lambda execution environment.

The error "libxslt.so.1: cannot open shared object file" indicates that the AWS Lambda environment cannot locate the libxslt.so.1 library, which is a dependency of the lxml package. Here's how to address this issue for your Python 3.11 Lambda function using lxml:
1. Use a Lambda Layer with Compatible Libraries:
Since the Python 3.11 base image for Lambda doesn't include libxslt.so.1, you'll need to create a Lambda layer containing the necessary libraries.
However, directly copying system libraries like libxslt.so.1 won't work due to potential compatibility issues with the Lambda environment.
Solution:
Build a Custom Docker Image: Create a Docker image based on a compatible Amazon Linux image (e.g., amazonlinux:2).
Install Dependencies: Use yum or dnf (depending on the image) to install libxml2-devel and libxslt-devel. These packages provide the development headers required for building lxml with the necessary dependencies.
Install lxml within the Image: Use pip install lxml to install the lxml package within your Docker image. This will ensure it's built with compatible libraries.
Copy Python Libraries: Copy the installed Python libraries (usually in /usr/local/lib/python3.x/site-packages) from your Docker image to a Lambda layer.
2. Consider Alternative Libraries:
If building a custom Docker image seems complex, explore alternative libraries that don't require additional system libraries. Potential options include:
beautifulsoup4: Provides similar functionalities to lxml for parsing XML/HTML.
html5lib: Another HTML parser library that might be suitable depending on your specific needs.
3. Update Poetry Configuration (if applicable):
While Poetry doesn't directly control including shared libraries, you can configure it to use a specific build environment that might have compatible libraries pre-installed. This approach might be more platform-specific and require experimentation.
Key Points:
Building a Lambda layer with compatible libraries from a custom Docker image is the recommended approach for including necessary dependencies for lxml in a Python 3.11 Lambda environment.
Consider alternative libraries if building a custom image is not feasible.
Avoid directly copying system libraries due to potential compatibility issues.
By following these suggestions, the AWS user should be able to resolve the missing library issue and successfully use lxml in their Python 3.11 Lambda function. Remember to choose the approach that best suits your project requirements and complexity.

## Q

To resolve the issue with the `lxml` library not loading correctly on AWS Lambda with Python 3.11, you can try the following:

1. **Create a custom Lambda layer**: Instead of including the `lxml` library directly in your Lambda function's deployment package, create a custom Lambda layer that includes the required shared libraries. This will ensure that all necessary dependencies are available at runtime.

   To create the custom layer:
   - Build a Docker image that includes the required shared libraries, such as `libxslt.so.1`.
   - Create a Lambda layer from the Docker image and attach it to your Lambda function.

2. **Use a different Python runtime**: If you're able to, consider using a different Python runtime version that has the required shared libraries pre-installed, such as Python 3.9 or 3.10.

3. **Manually include the shared libraries**: Alternatively, you can manually include the required shared libraries in your Lambda function's deployment package. This can be done by:
   - Identifying the specific shared libraries that `lxml` depends on.
   - Obtaining the shared libraries, either by building them yourself or finding pre-compiled versions.
   - Including the shared libraries in your Lambda function's deployment package, alongside the `lxml` library.

   This approach can be more complex and may require additional maintenance, but it can be a solution if the custom layer approach is not feasible.

4. **Check AWS Lambda documentation**: Refer to the AWS Lambda documentation for the latest information on supported runtimes, dependencies, and best practices for packaging Python libraries. The documentation may provide more up-to-date guidance on handling issues with specific libraries.

Remember, the specific steps may vary depending on your use case and the requirements of your application. It's always a good idea to thoroughly test your solution in a non-production environment before deploying it to production.
