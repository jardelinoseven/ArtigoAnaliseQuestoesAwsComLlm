## [Question 11 (Feb 22, 2024)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78041351/aws-eks-nodegroup-stuck-at-deleting-status)

AWS EKS nodeGroup stuck at 'deleting' status

I am using terraform to deploy the AWS infrastructure. I stuck at 
*EKS nodeGroup is deleting status* . The health shows that IAM role is not found, I created that role again and tries to update nodeGroup from CLI and it says

 *"An error occurred (ResourceInUseException) when calling the UpdateNodegroupVersion operation: Nodegroup cannot be updated as it is currently not in Active State"*


I am unable to delete cluster and nodeGroup from the CLI and from the terraform as well. In my terraform script nodeGroup have instance type is (SPOT - t3.medium) but when I checked nodeGroup from CLI I saw that the instance is ( on-demand t3.large). There is no such config in my terraform code.


```
main.tf: 
module "vpc" {
  source = "./modules/vpc"
  cluster_name = var.cluster_name
}

module "eks" {
  source = "./modules/eks"
  cluster_name = var.cluster_name
  private_subnet_ids = module.vpc.private_subnet_ids
  subnet_ids = module.vpc.subnet_ids
}


module "karpenter" {
  source = "./modules/karpenter"
  eks-nodeName = module.eks.eks-data
  eks-connect-provider-url = module.eks.aws_iam_openid_connect_provider
  eks-connect-provider-arn = module.eks.aws_iam_openid_connect_provider-arn
  cluster_name = module.eks.cluster_name
  private-nodes = module.eks.aws_eks_node_group-private-nodes
}

nodes.tf
resource "aws_eks_node_group" "private-nodes" {
  # count            = var.delete_nodegroup ? 1 : 0
  cluster_name = aws_eks_cluster.cluster.name
  node_group_name = "private-nodes"
  node_role_arn = aws_iam_role.nodes.arn
  
  # subnet_ids = [ 
  #   aws_subnet.private-eu-west-1a.id,
  #   aws_subnet.private-eu-west-1b.id
  #  ]

  subnet_ids = var.private_subnet_ids

    capacity_type  = "SPOT"
    instance_types = ["t3.medium"]

   scaling_config {
     desired_size = 1
     max_size = 6
     min_size = 1
   }

   update_config {
    max_unavailable = 1
   }

   labels = {
     role = "general"
   }

  
depends_on = [
    aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.nodes-AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy,
    aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.nodes-AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy,
    aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.nodes-AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly,
  ]

  # Allow external changes without Terraform plan difference
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [scaling_config[0].desired_size]
  }
  
}

```

I used this command to delete the nodeGroup
`aws eks delete-nodegroup --cluster-name eks-gd360 --nodegroup-name private-nodes --region eu-west-1`

I have followed these docs: [Deleting a managed node group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/delete-managed-node-group.html)

[deleting EKS cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/delete-cluster.html#w237aac13c27b9b3)


## Highest-scored answer 

I engaged with the AWS support billing team to address this issue, Initially, they recommended purchasing AWS Developer Support to access developer assistance for the problem at hand. I expressed my belief that the issue is AWS internal, and they agreed to investigate further.

After a period of 4 to 5 days, the support team took action by deleting the NodeGroup, which allowed me to delete the EKS cluster.

I asked them a technical reason and this is what they replied:

    This is an internal issue at the AWS end and this can occur due to various reasons. However, they've suggested you to wait till the current request is completed before you can submit next action. For example: When you create a Cluster wait for it to be successfully complete before initiating the creation of Node groups. If we avoid overlapping the requests while one is in progress we can avoid this error from repeating again.

I destroyed resources by terraform destroy, maybe issue occurred from terraform.

### **Troubleshooting AWS EKS NodeGroup Stuck in "Deleting" Status**
Your **AWS EKS NodeGroup is stuck in "Deleting" status** because the **IAM role is missing** or incorrectly configured. Since the node group cannot be updated while in a non-active state, you need to forcefully remove it.

---

## **Step 1: Identify the Root Cause**
1. **Check Node Group Status**
   ```sh
   aws eks describe-nodegroup --cluster-name eks-gd360 --nodegroup-name private-nodes --region eu-west-1
   ```
   - If the output includes **"IAM role not found"**, the role needs to be recreated.

2. **Check EC2 Instances in the NodeGroup**
   ```sh
   aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag:eks:nodegroup-name,Values=private-nodes"
   ```
   - If instances are still running, manually **terminate** them.

3. **Check Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**
   ```sh
   aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-groups --region eu-west-1 | grep eks-gd360
   ```
   - If an **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** still exists, delete it.

---

## **Step 2: Manually Force Delete the NodeGroup**
Since the IAM role was deleted, AWS is unable to complete the deletion process.

### **Option A: Detach Instances and ASG (Preferred)**
1. **Get the ASG Name**
   ```sh
   aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-groups --query "AutoScalingGroups[?contains(AutoScalingGroupName, 'eks')].AutoScalingGroupName" --region eu-west-1
   ```

2. **Set the ASG Desired Capacity to 0**
   ```sh
   aws autoscaling update-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name <asg-name> --desired-capacity 0 --region eu-west-1
   ```

3. **Delete the ASG**
   ```sh
   aws autoscaling delete-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name <asg-name> --region eu-west-1 --force-delete
   ```

4. **Delete the NodeGroup Again**
   ```sh
   aws eks delete-nodegroup --cluster-name eks-gd360 --nodegroup-name private-nodes --region eu-west-1
   ```

---

### **Option B: Delete EC2 Instances Manually**
1. **Get EC2 Instances Attached to the NodeGroup**
   ```sh
   aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag:eks:nodegroup-name,Values=private-nodes" --query "Reservations[].Instances[].InstanceId" --region eu-west-1
   ```

2. **Terminate All Instances**
   ```sh
   aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids <instance-id-1> <instance-id-2> --region eu-west-1
   ```

3. **Delete the NodeGroup Again**
   ```sh
   aws eks delete-nodegroup --cluster-name eks-gd360 --nodegroup-name private-nodes --region eu-west-1
   ```

---

## **Step 3: Force Delete the EKS Cluster (If Needed)**
If the cluster itself is stuck, follow these steps:

1. **Delete All Remaining NodeGroups**
   ```sh
   aws eks list-nodegroups --cluster-name eks-gd360 --region eu-west-1
   ```
   - If any remain, delete them one by one.

2. **Delete Cluster Finalizers (If Stuck)**
   ```sh
   aws eks delete-cluster --name eks-gd360 --region eu-west-1
   ```

3. **Force Delete VPC and Resources**
   - If Terraform fails, manually delete the **VPC, security groups, and subnets**.

---

## **Step 4: Prevent Future Issues**
- Ensure Terraform **manages IAM roles correctly**.
- Avoid deleting IAM roles while EKS is active.
- When updating Terraform, use:
  ```sh
  terraform state rm aws_eks_node_group.private-nodes
  ```

---

## **Conclusion**
| **Issue** | **Solution** |
|-----------|-------------|
| **NodeGroup stuck in "Deleting"** | Delete ASG & EC2 instances, then retry `delete-nodegroup` |
| **IAM role missing** | Recreate the IAM role & retry deletion |
| **EKS Cluster stuck** | Delete finalizers, force remove resources |
| **Terraform conflicts** | Remove state for the node group |

After these steps, you should be able to cleanly remove the **stuck EKS NodeGroup**. Let me know if you need further help! 🚀

It appears you're facing a tricky situation with your EKS node group stuck in a 'deleting' state. This can happen due to a few reasons, and the unexpected instance type and IAM role issues further complicate things. Let's break down the problem and potential solutions:

**Understanding the Issues**

* **Node Group in `deleting` State:** This usually means that the node group deletion process has encountered an error and cannot proceed. The underlying EC2 instances might be failing to terminate, or there might be issues with dependencies on other resources.
* **IAM Role Issues:** The "IAM role not found" error suggests that the node group was initially created with an IAM role that has since been deleted or modified. Even though you recreated the role, the node group might be referencing the old role's ARN.
* **Instance Type Mismatch:** The discrepancy between the desired instance type (`t3.medium`) and the actual instance type (`t3.large`) indicates that something altered the node group configuration outside of Terraform. This could be due to manual changes, drift, or even an AWS issue.

**Troubleshooting and Solutions**

1. **Force Delete the Node Group:** Since the node group is stuck, you might need to force delete it using the AWS CLI. This bypasses some of the usual checks and can sometimes resolve the issue. However, use this with caution as it might have unintended consequences.

   ```bash
   aws eks delete-nodegroup --cluster-name eks-gd360 --nodegroup-name private-nodes --force --region eu-west-1
   ```

2. **Investigate EC2 Instances:**
   * Go to the EC2 console and check the status of the instances associated with the node group. Are they terminating? Are they stuck in an error state?
   * If the instances are stuck, try terminating them manually. This might unblock the node group deletion.

3. **Check for Dependencies:** Ensure that no other resources depend on the node group or its instances. This could include things like:
   * Load balancers
   * Security groups
   * Persistent volumes

4. **Examine CloudWatch Logs:** Look for any error messages or clues in the CloudWatch logs for your EKS cluster and the node group.

5. **Update Node Group with Correct IAM Role (If Possible):** If force deletion fails, you can try updating the node group with the correct IAM role ARN using the AWS CLI. However, as you mentioned, this might not be possible if the node group is not in an `ACTIVE` state.

6. **Contact AWS Support:** If none of the above solutions work, it's best to contact AWS Support. They have tools and insights to investigate the issue and potentially resolve it manually.

**Preventing Future Issues**

* **Terraform State Management:** Ensure you have a robust Terraform state management system to prevent accidental changes outside of Terraform.
* **IAM Role Management:** Carefully manage your IAM roles and avoid deleting roles that are in use by other resources.
* **Regularly Review Node Group Configuration:** Periodically check your node group configurations to detect any drift or unexpected changes.

**Important Notes**

* **Data Loss:** If you have applications running on the node group, force deleting it will result in data loss. Ensure you have backups or other recovery mechanisms in place.
* **Terraform Apply After Resolution:** Once you resolve the issue and delete the node group, run `terraform apply` to ensure that Terraform's state is consistent with the actual infrastructure.

By systematically working through these steps and with potential assistance from AWS Support, you should be able to resolve the stuck node group and regain control of your EKS cluster.

To resolve the **EKS nodeGroup stuck in 'deleting' status** and conflicting configurations, follow these steps:

---

### **1. Force Delete the Stuck NodeGroup**
When Terraform/AWS CLI fails, manually delete dependencies blocking the nodeGroup deletion:  
#### **Check for Orphaned Resources**  
- **Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs)**:  
  ```bash
  aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-groups --query "AutoScalingGroups[?contains(Tags[?Key=='eks:nodegroup-name'].Value, 'private-nodes')].AutoScalingGroupName" --region eu-west-1
  ```
  Delete any ASGs linked to the nodeGroup:  
  ```bash
  aws autoscaling delete-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name <ASG_NAME> --force-delete --region eu-west-1
  ```

- **EC2 Instances**:  
  Terminate instances tagged with `eks:nodegroup-name: private-nodes`.

- **IAM Role Associations**:  
  Ensure no other resources (e.g., EC2 instances, Lambda) are using the nodeGroup’s IAM role.

---

### **2. Fix Terraform State & Configuration**
#### **Address Configuration Drift**  
The nodeGroup using `t3.large` instead of `t3.medium` indicates **state drift** (e.g., manual edits via AWS Console).  
- **Refresh Terraform State**:  
  ```bash
  terraform apply -refresh-only
  ```
- **Remove the NodeGroup from Terraform State**:  
  ```bash
  terraform state rm aws_eks_node_group.private-nodes
  ```
- **Delete the NodeGroup via AWS CLI**:  
  ```bash
  aws eks delete-nodegroup --cluster-name eks-gd360 --nodegroup-name private-nodes --region eu-west-1
  ```
- **Reimport the NodeGroup** (optional):  
  After deletion, update your Terraform code and reimport:  
  ```bash
  terraform import aws_eks_node_group.private-nodes eks-gd360:private-nodes
  ```

---

### **3. Fix IAM Role Issues**
#### **Validate IAM Role Permissions**  
Ensure the nodeGroup’s IAM role (`aws_iam_role.nodes.arn`) has:  
- **Attached Policies**:  
  ```json
  {
    "PolicyArns": [
      "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy",
      "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy",
      "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly"
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Trust Relationship**:  
  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": { "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com" },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }]
  }
  ```

---

### **4. Clean Up Karpenter Resources**
If Karpenter is managing nodes, delete its provisioners:  
```bash
kubectl delete provisioner --all -A
```

---

### **5. Delete the EKS Cluster**
Once the nodeGroup is removed, delete the cluster:  
```bash
aws eks delete-cluster --name eks-gd360 --region eu-west-1
```
If stuck, manually delete cluster dependencies:  
- **CloudWatch Log Groups**: `/aws/eks/eks-gd360/cluster`.  
- **VPC Resources**: Subnets, security groups, or NAT gateways created by Terraform.

---

### **6. Re-Deploy with Correct Terraform Code**
#### **Avoid Spot/On-Demand Conflicts**  
Update your `nodes.tf` to enforce instance types:  
```hcl
resource "aws_eks_node_group" "private-nodes" {
  # ... other config ...
  capacity_type  = "SPOT"
  instance_types = ["t3.medium"]
}
```

#### **Add Explicit Dependencies**  
Ensure the `karpenter` module depends on the nodeGroup:  
```hcl
module "karpenter" {
  # ... other config ...
  depends_on = [aws_eks_node_group.private-nodes]
}
```

---

### **7. Use Terraform Force Flags (If Stuck)**
Add `terraform destroy -auto-approve` with `-refresh=false` to bypass state issues (use cautiously).

---

### **8. Contact AWS Support**
If the nodeGroup remains stuck, open a support ticket with:  
- Cluster/NodeGroup ARN.  
- Error logs from AWS Console/CloudTrail.  

---

### **Final Checks**
1. **Terraform Version**: Use ≥ v1.5.0 for EKS improvements.  
2. **AWS CLI Version**: Update to ≥ v2.11.0.  
3. **IAM Permissions**: Ensure Terraform/AWS CLI has `eks:DeleteNodegroup` and `autoscaling:DeleteAutoScalingGroup` permissions.  

By resolving dependencies and aligning Terraform with AWS resources, the nodeGroup deletion should succeed. Let me know if you need further help! 🚀

## ChatGPT o1

Below are some common reasons why a managed node group can get stuck in “Deleting” status – and the practical steps to clean it up so you can proceed with either re‑creating or fully deleting the EKS infrastructure. In short, your node group references an IAM role that was removed or changed, leaving the node group in a partial state that can’t be updated or removed in the usual way.

---

## 1. The Node Group’s Underlying IAM Role Was Deleted or Changed

### Why It Causes the “Deleting” Hang
Managed node groups store the IAM role ARN at creation. If that role is later deleted, the node group can’t complete lifecycle actions (e.g., scale, update, or delete). Even recreating a new IAM role with the *same name* won’t fix the reference, because internally AWS tracks the unique ARN (which includes a unique ID for each IAM role).

### Potential Workarounds
1. **Recreate the Original Role (Exact ARN)**: Unfortunately, you can’t restore a deleted IAM role with the exact same ARN. The new role always gets a new ARN. This means EKS can’t “see” it as the same role.  
2. **Contact AWS Support**: If the stuck node group is blocking everything else, sometimes AWS Support can remove the stale reference on the backend.  
3. **Force-delete the EKS Cluster**: If you just want to blow away the cluster, try removing the entire cluster in the AWS console or CLI. In many cases, EKS will forcibly remove the stale node group. You can do:  
   ```bash
   aws eks delete-cluster --name eks-gd360 --region eu-west-1
   ```
   If that fails because the node group is stuck, you might need to contact support to forcibly remove the node group from the cluster so the cluster can be deleted.

---

## 2. Attempt the Usual Cleanup Steps (Sometimes They Work)

Before escalating, try:

1. **Wait and Retry**: Occasionally, AWS will eventually complete a stuck node group deletion. Check the EKS console again after 10–30 minutes.  
2. **Double-check**: 
   - You’re using the correct cluster name and region in your `aws eks delete-nodegroup` command.  
   - The node group name matches exactly (“private-nodes”).  
3. **Use the EKS Console**: Sometimes the console can succeed where Terraform or CLI fails. Go to the EKS console, open your cluster, select “Configuration” > “Compute,” find the node group, and click “Delete.”

If you still get `ResourceInUseException` or see the node group stuck in “Deleting,” proceed with further steps.

---

## 3. Remove References in Terraform

If Terraform is still referencing the stuck node group, it will keep trying to manage or delete it. Consider:

1. **Comment Out / Remove** the `aws_eks_node_group.private-nodes` resource in your Terraform code.  
2. **Run `terraform apply`** so Terraform no longer tries to manage that resource. This can sometimes let AWS proceed with its own removal attempts.  
3. If you are trying to delete the entire cluster via Terraform (`terraform destroy`), you may need to forcibly remove the node group resource from Terraform’s state to avoid errors:
   ```bash
   terraform state rm aws_eks_node_group.private-nodes
   ```
   Then re-run `terraform destroy`.

---

## 4. If All Else Fails: AWS Support

If the node group remains stuck in “Deleting” despite attempts via console, CLI, or Terraform:

- **Open a Support Case**. Provide them with the cluster name, region, node group name, and relevant logs.  
- They can remove stale references or forcibly detach the node group from your cluster so you can proceed with your deployments or cluster deletion.

---

## 5. Why the Node Group’s Spot vs. On-Demand Types Differ in the Console?

You mentioned seeing “SPOT” in Terraform but “on-demand t3.large” in the CLI or console. This mismatch can happen if:

- The node group was originally created differently (with a different instance type or capacity type), and that older config is what actually got created in AWS.  
- The Terraform resource never fully replaced or updated the node group in AWS.  
- Or the node group was created outside of Terraform with those instance types, and Terraform’s code is out of sync.  

Because the node group is stuck, it can’t pick up new Terraform changes. Once you fix or remove the stuck node group, re-creating it with the correct `capacity_type = "SPOT"` and `instance_types = ["t3.medium"]` should work properly.

---

### Summary of Action Plan

1. **Remove** references to the stuck node group in Terraform (comment out or `terraform state rm`) so Terraform stops trying to manage it.  
2. **Try** to delete it from the EKS console or via the CLI with `aws eks delete-nodegroup`.  
3. **Attempt** to delete the entire cluster if the node group won’t go away and you no longer need the cluster.  
4. **Contact AWS Support** to forcibly remove the stale node group if all else fails.  

This typically resolves the “deleting” status problem for EKS node groups that lost their original IAM role or got out of sync with Terraform.

## Analysis 

Note: The five LLMs have been anonymized in the analysis below, as follows: ChatGPT-4o is Chatbot #1, Gemini 2.0 Flash is Chatbot #2, Q is Chatbot #3, DeepSeek R1 is Chatbot #4 and ChatGPT-o1 is Chatbot #5

Below is a structured analysis of each chatbot response compared to the **baseline** answer from Stack Overflow:

---

## Baseline Summary

The key points from the baseline are:

1. **NodeGroup is stuck in "deleting"** due to an internal AWS issue: 
   - The user found that the node group’s IAM role was missing. 
   - Recreating the role didn’t help because AWS references the original role ARN.
2. AWS Support eventually deleted the NodeGroup from the backend, allowing the user to remove the cluster.
3. AWS recommended waiting for a request to complete before submitting another request (e.g., ensure one resource is fully created before starting creation/deletion of the next).
4. The user suspects Terraform’s “destroy” might have caused the concurrency issue.

Hence, the baseline solution is **that AWS had to intervene** to remove the stuck resource, and the user learned to avoid overlapping provisioning or destruction steps in the future.

---

## Chatbot Response #1

### Accuracy
- They propose typical reasons and solutions for an EKS NodeGroup stuck in "Deleting" (missing IAM role, an incomplete resource preventing final removal).
- They do not explicitly mention that AWS might have to intervene. Instead, they assume manual steps can fix it (terminating instances, removing ASGs, etc.).
- The baseline specifically says AWS Support had to do it on the backend. 
- However, the recommended steps are valid potential solutions for typical NodeGroup deletion issues.

**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory** (the user’s real fix required AWS intervention, but #1’s suggestions are standard EKS NodeGroup stuck-deletion steps, and partially align with the baseline’s mention that the resource was stuck due to missing IAM role.)

### Completeness
- The response includes thorough steps: checking ASGs, forcibly removing them, terminating EC2, re-checking the node group. 
- Doesn’t mention “AWS eventually had to remove it” or that waiting might be needed, but it does mention final “If stuck, remove cluster resources, etc.”

**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**  

### Clarity
- Very well structured, step-by-step, with headings.  
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

### Practicality
- The suggestions are indeed typical ways to remove stuck EKS NodeGroups. 
- The baseline specifically required AWS side fix, but #1’s approach might solve it in many cases. 
**Rating**: **Satisfactory** (It’s missing the direct statement “you may need to contact AWS,” but the instructions are still quite practical.)

**Overall Rating (Response #1): Partially Satisfactory**

---

## Chatbot Response #2

### Accuracy
- Mentions normal issues: a node group in “deleting” can be caused by dependencies or concurrency problems. 
- Recommends possibly forcing deletion with the `--force` flag (which EKS delete-nodegroup may or may not support?), investigating EC2 instances, checking logs, or contacting AWS Support. 
- The baseline says that the user ended up going to AWS Support. 
- Suggests standard debugging steps, not specifically referencing that the user’s problem was missing IAM role and an internal AWS mismatch. But that’s still plausible.

**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory** (They do mention AWS Support if all else fails.)

### Completeness
- Covers typical solutions: forced deletion, checking references. 
- Doesn’t mention that AWS might do a manual backend fix or that you have to wait for requests to complete. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

### Clarity
- The response is fairly coherent, enumerating possible solutions.  
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

### Practicality
- Steps are general and feasible. 
- Doesn’t mention the user’s exact scenario about the missing IAM role, though it references role issues. 
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #2): Partially Satisfactory**

---

## Chatbot Response #3

### Accuracy
- The reply doesn't provide a direct solution. It only requests more info. 
- The baseline shows the user overcame the problem via AWS support. #3 does not mention any fix.  
**Rating**: **Unsatisfactory**

### Completeness
- It offers no direct guidance, ignoring the baseline’s mention of a known AWS internal fix or concurrency problem. 
**Rating**: **Unsatisfactory**

### Clarity
- It's only a set of questions, no solution. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory** for clarity, but not addressing the problem.

### Practicality
- No actionable steps. 
**Rating**: **Unsatisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #3): Unsatisfactory**

---

## Chatbot Response #4

### Accuracy
- Mentions forcibly removing the node group, dealing with architecture. Actually, the mention of architecture mismatch is not relevant. Possibly a leftover from a different context. 
- The main suggestions: forcibly delete the node group, fix the node group drift in Terraform, remove references if it’s stuck, or contact support. That is in line with the typical approach for stuck node groups. 
- The baseline’s big takeaway is that AWS had to fix an internal problem. #4 does mention you might contact AWS Support if all else fails. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory** (some steps might be extraneous or not entirely matching the user’s scenario, but generally correct about removing stuck resources.)

### Completeness
- Tells how to remove resources, fix IAM role references, handle Terraform drift. 
- Doesn’t mention concurrency or waiting for previous requests, or that AWS had to do a manual fix. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

### Clarity
- Stepwise approach is well laid out. 
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

### Practicality
- Provides many relevant steps for forcibly removing stuck node groups and cluster. 
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #4): Partially Satisfactory**

---

## Chatbot Response #5

### Accuracy
- Suggests that if the IAM role is missing (like in the baseline), the node group can’t complete deletion. 
- Mentions that re-creating a role with the same name won’t fix the original ARN reference. Recommends removing references in Terraform, waiting, or calling AWS support for a forced removal. 
- This matches the baseline scenario closely: “AWS had to fix it because the missing role was an internal AWS reference.” 
**Rating**: **Satisfactory** (It’s quite aligned with the baseline’s scenario.)

### Completeness
- Also points out we might forcibly remove references in Terraform, or contact AWS if it remains stuck. 
- Mentions the user discovered a mismatch in instance type (drift) and references how to handle it. 
- The baseline’s main point was eventually AWS support had to remove it. #5 mentions that if all else fails, contact AWS support. 
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

### Clarity
- Nicely structured, straightforward. 
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

### Practicality
- Very actionable: remove references in TF, try deleting the node group or the cluster, contact AWS if stuck. 
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #5): Satisfactory**  
It most closely matches the baseline’s mention that an AWS internal fix is sometimes needed.
