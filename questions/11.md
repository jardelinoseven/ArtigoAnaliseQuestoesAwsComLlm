## [Question 11](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75740175/error-configuring-terraform-aws-provider-failed-to-get-shared-config-profile)

Error: configuring Terraform AWS Provider: failed to get shared config profile, <profile>

in my `main.tf` file I have:

```terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.16"
    }
  }

  required_version = ">= 1.2.0"
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}
````

When I run `terraform plan`, I am getting the error below:

```Error: configuring Terraform AWS Provider: failed to get shared config profile, terragrunt
 
   with provider["registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws"],
   on provider.tf line 2, in provider "aws":
    2: provider "aws" {
```        
In my case, I'm not using `terragrunt` in the project at all, purely terraform and the error message isn't helpful.

## Highest-scored answer 

My `AWS_PROFILE` env variable was set to `terragrunt`. And because my `~/.aws/credentials` file didn't have a profile for terragrunt, I was getting the error. I had to set it to an existing profile and my problem was fixed.

__Context:__

The `shared config profile` terraform is talking about has to do with the provider.profile variable in main.tf, AWS_PROFILE environment variable, and the ~/.aws/credentials file. In that order of prescedence.

If your `~/.aws/credentials` doesn't have a default profile, then you must point to it explicitly. For example, if it looks like below:

```[https://sso.jumpcloud.com/saml2/aws]
aws_access_key_id        = <example-id>
aws_secret_access_key    = <example-key>
Then you have to either
````

run export `AWS_PROFILE=https://sso.jumpcloud.com/saml2/aws`

or

manually specify the `profile` in your `main.tf`

```provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
  profile = "https://sso.jumpcloud.com/saml2/aws"
}
```

The error message you are encountering suggests that Terraform is trying to use a shared configuration profile named `terragrunt`, but it can't find it. This can happen due to several reasons, such as environment variables being set incorrectly or missing configuration in your AWS credentials file.

Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

### 1. Verify AWS CLI Configuration
Ensure that your AWS CLI is properly configured and that the profile `terragrunt` (or the one you are intending to use) exists.

Check your AWS credentials file (typically located at `~/.aws/credentials`):
```ini
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY

[terragrunt]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```

If the `terragrunt` profile is not intended to be used, make sure the correct profile is configured or used.

### 2. Specify the Profile in the Provider Block
Explicitly specify the AWS profile in your Terraform configuration if you are using a specific profile:
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region  = "us-west-2"
  profile = "your_profile_name"  # Replace with the correct profile name
}
```

### 3. Check Environment Variables
Ensure that environment variables like `AWS_PROFILE`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are correctly set if you are using them. You can unset or reset them if necessary:
```sh
export AWS_PROFILE=your_profile_name  # Replace with the correct profile name
```

### 4. Terraform Backend Configuration
If you are using a Terraform backend that might have profile configurations, check those settings as well. 

### 5. Clean Up and Reinitialize Terraform
Sometimes, cached configurations can cause issues. Clean up Terraformâ€™s working directory and reinitialize:
```sh
terraform init -reconfigure
```

### Example Main Configuration with Profile
Here is how your `main.tf` might look if you need to specify the profile explicitly:
```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.16"
    }
  }
  required_version = ">= 1.2.0"
}

provider "aws" {
  region  = "us-west-2"
  profile = "your_profile_name"  # Replace with the correct profile name
}
```

### 6. Verify No Incorrect References to `terragrunt`
Since you mentioned you are not using `terragrunt`, double-check that there are no stray references or configurations related to `terragrunt` in your Terraform files or environment settings.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error related to configuring the Terraform AWS Provider. If the issue persists, consider providing additional context or details about your environment and configuration.


## ChatGPT-4

The error message you're encountering suggests that Terraform is attempting to use a shared config profile named "terragrunt" instead of the AWS profile you intend to use. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

1. **Verify AWS Credentials Configuration**:
   - Ensure that you have configured your AWS credentials properly either using environment variables, shared credentials file (~/.aws/credentials), or AWS config file (~/.aws/config).
   - Check if the AWS profile you intend to use is correctly specified in the AWS credentials or config file. It seems like Terraform is trying to use a profile named "terragrunt" instead of the one you specified.

2. **Check Terraform Environment**:
   - Verify that you are running Terraform in an environment where the AWS credentials are accessible. For example, if you're running Terraform within a CI/CD pipeline or from a different user context, make sure the necessary AWS credentials are available in that environment.

3. **Review Terraform Provider Configuration**:
   - Double-check your Terraform provider configuration to ensure that the AWS provider is correctly defined and referencing the desired AWS profile. In your case, it seems like the provider configuration is straightforward, but confirm that it's not being overridden elsewhere in your Terraform configuration files.

4. **Clear Terraform Cache**:
   - Sometimes Terraform's cache can cause issues. Try clearing the Terraform cache by deleting the .terraform directory in your project directory and re-running Terraform commands.

5. **Update Terraform and AWS Provider**:
   - Ensure that you are using the latest version of Terraform and the AWS provider. Sometimes, issues like this can be resolved by upgrading to the latest versions, as they may contain bug fixes or improvements.

6. **Check for Terragrunt Configuration**:
   - Even though you mentioned that you're not using Terragrunt, double-check your project directory for any Terragrunt configuration files (e.g., terragrunt.hcl). Terragrunt might be inadvertently affecting the Terraform execution.

7. **Debugging and Logging**:
   - Enable debug mode in Terraform (using TF_LOG=DEBUG environment variable) to get more detailed logs. This might provide additional insights into what Terraform is doing and why it's trying to use the "terragrunt" profile.

By following these steps and investigating the potential causes outlined above, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue with Terraform attempting to use the incorrect AWS profile.


## Gemini

The error message "failed to get shared config profile, terragrunt" indicates Terraform is trying to find an AWS provider configuration in a profile named "terragrunt" within your shared credentials file. Here's how the AWS user can troubleshoot and resolve this issue:
Possible Causes:
Incorrect Configuration: There might be an unwanted reference to the "terragrunt" profile in your Terraform configuration.
Shared Credentials File: Terraform searches for provider configurations within profiles defined in your shared credentials file (e.g., ~/.aws/credentials or ~/.aws/config). An entry for a "terragrunt" profile might exist there.
Troubleshooting Steps:
Review Terraform Configuration: Double-check your Terraform code, specifically the provider block in provider.tf. Ensure there are no references to a profile named "terragrunt."
Inspect Shared Credentials File: Locate your shared credentials file (usually ~/.aws/credentials). Open it with a text editor and examine its contents. Look for any profiles named "terragrunt" and remove them if they exist.
Resolving the Issue:
If you find a "terragrunt" profile in your shared credentials file and don't use Terragrunt, remove that profile entry completely.
If there's no reference to "terragrunt" in your Terraform code or shared credentials file, consider these possibilities:
Outdated Configuration: If you recently migrated from Terragrunt, there might be leftover configuration referencing the "terragrunt" profile. Double-check your Terraform code for any remnants.
Caching: In rare cases, Terraform might be caching outdated configuration. Try clearing the Terraform cache using terraform init -force-copy.
Additional Tips:
Consider using environment variables or a separate configuration file to store your AWS credentials instead of relying on the shared credentials file. This improves security and avoids conflicts.
Ensure you have the AWS provider configured correctly within your Terraform code, specifying the region and any other necessary details.
By following these steps, the AWS user should be able to resolve the "failed to get shared config profile, terragrunt" error and successfully use the AWS provider in their Terraform project.


## Q

To resolve the issue with the error "configuring Terraform AWS Provider: failed to get shared config profile, <profile>", you can try the following:

1. Verify your AWS credentials:
   - Ensure that you have the necessary AWS credentials (access key and secret key) configured correctly on your system.
   - You can check the credentials by running the AWS CLI command `aws sts get-caller-identity`.

2. Check your AWS profile configuration:
   - Ensure that the AWS profile specified in your Terraform configuration (in this case, "terragrunt") is correctly configured in your AWS credentials file (typically located at `~/.aws/credentials` on Unix-like systems or `%USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials` on Windows).
   - If the profile is not configured, you can add it to the credentials file or use a different profile that is configured correctly.

3. Use environment variables for AWS credentials:
   - Instead of relying on a shared AWS profile, you can set the AWS credentials as environment variables:
     ```
     export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_access_key_id>
     export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_secret_access_key>
     export AWS_REGION=us-west-2
     ```
   - Then, in your Terraform configuration, remove the `provider` block and let Terraform use the environment variables.

4. Specify the AWS credentials directly in the Terraform configuration:
   - In your `provider` block, you can directly specify the AWS credentials instead of relying on a shared profile:
     ```
     provider "aws" {
       access_key = "<your_access_key_id>"
       secret_key = "<your_secret_access_key>"
       region     = "us-west-2"
     }
     ```

5. Check for any other Terraform configurations or tools (like Terragrunt) that might be interfering with the AWS provider configuration.

If the issue persists, you can refer to the AWS documentation on [Configuring the AWS Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#authentication) for more information.
