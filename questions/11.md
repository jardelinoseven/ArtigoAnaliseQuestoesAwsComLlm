Inaccessible-encryption-credentials status of AWS RDS instance
when i tried to access the AWS RDS instance, i could see the status of RDS instance as Inaccessible-encryption-credentials .But the key key is available in KMS(Key Managed Service). How can i retrieve the instance ?
how can i make the instance available ?


## Highest-scored answer 


The Inaccessible-encryption-credentials status appears because the keys used for encryption have access limitations.

To resolve this, you need to enable permissions on the KMS keys. Once permissions are enabled, you will need to manually start the cluster.

It seems that the option to start the cluster is not available in the UI in this scenario.

You can start the cluster using the AWS CLI with the following command:

aws rds start-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier <cluster-identifier>
