## Baseline answer 

Now an actual answer.

Run:

rpm --import https://repo.mysql.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql-2023

Notice the "2023"

Apparently they updated the GPG keys... Never found any reference to this, just tried out the command and it worked.


## ChatGPT 4o

The **GPG key error** when installing MySQL on **Amazon Linux 2023** (`amzn2023`) happens because Amazon Linux 2023 has stricter package verification policies and does not support **traditional YUM repositories like MySQL's official repo** by default.

### **Solution: Use MySQL from Amazon Linux 2023's Official Repository**
Amazon Linux 2023 **does not support external YUM repositories natively**. Instead, it uses **dnf** and provides **MySQL 8.0** in its official repositories.

#### **Steps to Fix the Issue:**
1. **Remove the existing MySQL repository (if added manually)**
   ```sh
   sudo rm -f /etc/yum.repos.d/mysql-community.repo
   ```

2. **Clean YUM cache and metadata**
   ```sh
   sudo yum clean all
   sudo dnf clean all
   ```

3. **Install MySQL directly from Amazon Linux's repository**
   ```sh
   sudo dnf install mysql-server
   ```

4. **Enable MySQL to start on boot and start the service**
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl enable --now mysqld
   ```

5. **Check MySQL service status**
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl status mysqld
   ```

6. **Get the temporary MySQL root password (if needed)**
   ```sh
   sudo grep 'temporary password' /var/log/mysqld.log
   ```

‚úÖ **Why this works?**
- Amazon Linux 2023 provides **MySQL 8.0** in its **default repositories**, meaning there‚Äôs no need to use the MySQL Community Repo.
- The issue happens because **MySQL‚Äôs official repository is not fully compatible with Amazon Linux 2023's GPG key policies**.

---

### **Alternative: Force Install MySQL from MySQL Community Repo**
If you **must** use MySQL's official community repository instead of Amazon‚Äôs official version, follow these steps:

1. **Remove existing GPG keys**
   ```sh
   sudo rpm --erase gpg-pubkey-3a79bd29-*
   sudo rpm --erase gpg-pubkey-mysql-*
   ```

2. **Manually import the correct MySQL GPG key**
   ```sh
   sudo rpm --import https://repo.mysql.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql-2022
   ```

3. **Reinstall MySQL with `--nogpgcheck` (not recommended for production)**
   ```sh
   sudo yum install mysql-community-server --nogpgcheck
   ```

4. **Start and enable MySQL**
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl enable --now mysqld
   ```

üö® **Warning:** Using `--nogpgcheck` bypasses security checks and is **not recommended** unless necessary.

---

### **Final Recommendation**
| **Approach** | **Recommended?** | **Why?** |
|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Install MySQL from Amazon Linux's default repository (`dnf install mysql-server`)** | ‚úÖ Yes (Best option) | Fully compatible with Amazon Linux 2023 |
| **Use MySQL Community Repo with `--nogpgcheck`** | ‚ö†Ô∏è No (Not secure) | Bypasses GPG checks, may break updates |

For **Amazon Linux 2023**, always prefer **`dnf install mysql-server`** instead of manually adding repositories.

## Gemini

The issue you're facing is related to GPG key verification for the MySQL 8.0 Community Server repository. Even though you've imported the key, `yum` is still unable to verify the packages against it. This could be due to a few reasons:

**1. Incorrect Key Configuration:**

* **Multiple Keys:** You might have multiple MySQL GPG keys installed, and `yum` might be using the wrong one for verification.
* **Outdated Key:** The key you imported might be outdated. MySQL occasionally updates its GPG keys.

**2. Repository Configuration:**

* **Incorrect Key URL:** The MySQL repository configuration might be pointing to an incorrect or outdated key URL.

**3. Yum Cache:**

* **Cached Packages:** `Yum` might be using cached packages that were downloaded before the correct key was imported.

**Here's how to resolve the issue:**

**1. Clean Yum Cache:**

```bash
sudo yum clean all
```

This clears the `yum` cache, forcing it to download fresh packages and metadata.

**2. Update Repository Configuration:**

* **Download the Repository File:** Download the latest MySQL 8.0 Community Server repository file for Amazon Linux 2023:

```bash
wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql80-community-release-el9-3.noarch.rpm
```

* **Install the Repository File:**

```bash
sudo rpm -ivh mysql80-community-release-el9-3.noarch.rpm
```

* **Verify Key Configuration:** The repository file should configure the correct GPG key URL. You can verify this by inspecting the repository file:

```bash
cat /etc/yum.repos.d/mysql80-community.repo
```

Look for the `gpgkey` line in the `[mysql80-community]` section. It should point to the correct key URL.

**3.  Import the Key (If Necessary):**

* If the key URL in the repository file is different from the one you previously imported, import the correct key:

```bash
sudo rpm --import <key_url>
```

Replace `<key_url>` with the actual key URL from the repository file.

**4. Install MySQL Server:**

```bash
sudo yum install mysql-community-server
```

This should now install MySQL server without the GPG key error.

**Additional Tips:**

* **List Installed Keys:** You can list the installed GPG keys using:

```bash
rpm -qa | grep gpg-pubkey
```

* **Remove Old Keys:** If you find multiple MySQL keys, you can remove the old ones using:

```bash
sudo rpm -e <key_name>
```

* **Check for Updates:** Ensure your Amazon Linux 2023 system is up-to-date:

```bash
sudo yum update
```

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the GPG key error and successfully install MySQL server on your Amazon Linux 2023 EC2 instance.

## DeepSeek R1

To resolve the **GPG key error** when installing MySQL on Amazon Linux 2023, follow these steps:

---

### **1. Fix the MySQL Repository Configuration**
The error occurs because the repository file references an invalid GPG key path. Update the MySQL repository configuration to use the correct HTTPS URL for the GPG key:

```bash
# Edit the MySQL repository file
sudo nano /etc/yum.repos.d/mysql-community.repo
```

Under the `[mysql80-community]` section, replace the `gpgkey` line with:
```ini
gpgkey=https://repo.mysql.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql-2022
```

Save and exit.

---

### **2. Clean Yum/DNF Cache**
Remove cached metadata to force a refresh:
```bash
sudo dnf clean all
```

---

### **3. Re-Import the GPG Key**
Manually download and import the correct key:
```bash
# Download the key
sudo curl -o /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql-2022 https://repo.mysql.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql-2022

# Import the key into RPM database
sudo rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql-2022
```

---

### **4. Install MySQL**
Retry the installation:
```bash
sudo dnf install mysql-community-server
```

---

### **5. Verify GPG Key (Optional)**
Check the imported key matches MySQL‚Äôs official fingerprint:
```bash
rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-$(rpm -qa gpg-pubkey | grep mysql | cut -d- -f3)
```
The fingerprint should end with `3A79 BD29` (for MySQL 8.0).

---

### **Alternative: Disable GPG Check (Not Recommended)**
If the issue persists (temporarily bypass GPG verification):
```bash
sudo dnf install --nogpgcheck mysql-community-server
```

---

### **Why This Happens**
- **Amazon Linux 2023 Compatibility**: The default MySQL repository config may reference a local GPG key path (`file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql-2022`) that doesn‚Äôt exist.
- **Key Mismatch**: The key imported via `rpm --import` wasn‚Äôt linked to the repository‚Äôs expected path.

---

### **Final Checks**
- Ensure no conflicting MySQL repositories exist in `/etc/yum.repos.d/`.
- Confirm your EC2 instance has internet access to download packages.

By correcting the repository configuration and re-importing the key, the installation should succeed. Let me know if you need further help! üöÄ

## ChatGPT o1

Below are some reasons why you get the ‚ÄúGPG check FAILED‚Äù error installing MySQL 8 on Amazon Linux 2023, along with ways to fix it. In short, there is a mismatch between the MySQL packages you‚Äôre installing and the GPG key(s) recognized by your system. You must ensure you have the correct MySQL GPG key for these packages, and that Amazon Linux 2023 (AL2023) is pulling from a matching repository.

---

## 1. MySQL Official Repos May Not Fully Support AL2023 Yet

Amazon Linux 2023 is relatively new, and MySQL‚Äôs official repositories are designed/tested primarily for RHEL/CentOS/OracleLinux distributions (and sometimes Fedora). Even if you manage to add the MySQL Yum repo on AL2023, the GPG signature check can fail if MySQL‚Äôs repository metadata was built for a different OS variant (for example, ‚Äúel9‚Äù for RHEL 9).  

**Possible approach**:  
- Make sure you‚Äôre adding the correct ‚Äúel9‚Äù repo for MySQL 8.0 so that it matches Amazon Linux 2023‚Äôs package structure more closely.  
- Keep in mind that MySQL‚Äôs official docs don‚Äôt explicitly list Amazon Linux 2023 as supported (yet). Some users must do extra workarounds or switch to a community-managed approach.

---

## 2. You Might Have Imported the Wrong or Duplicate GPG Key

The error states the GPG key is ‚Äúalready installed‚Äù but ‚Äúnot correct for this package.‚Äù That suggests the key your system has does not match the signatures on the MySQL 8.0.36 packages.

**Check which MySQL key(s) are installed**:
```bash
rpm -q gpg-pubkey --qf "%{name}-%{version}-%{release}  %{summary}\n"
```
You may see multiple lines referencing MySQL GPG keys, e.g. ‚Äúgpg-pubkey-5072e1f5-5xxxxxxx MySQL Release Engineering ‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚Äúgpg-pubkey-3a79bd29-xxxxxxxx MySQL Release Engineering ‚Ä¶‚Äù

**Remove incorrect ones**, if needed:
```bash
sudo rpm -e gpg-pubkey-3a79bd29-xxxxxxxx
sudo rpm -e gpg-pubkey-5072e1f5-5xxxxxxx
# etc.
```
Then **re-import** the official MySQL 2022 key (or whichever MySQL docs say is needed for 8.0.36) carefully:
```bash
sudo rpm --import https://repo.mysql.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql-2022
```
Now try installing again:
```bash
sudo yum clean all
sudo yum install mysql-community-server
```
If you still see a mismatch, double-check you‚Äôre using the correct MySQL repo file for your distribution (el9 or ‚ÄúRed Hat Enterprise Linux 9‚Äù-compatible).

---

## 3. Make Sure the Yum Repo Definition Matches the Key

When you add the MySQL Yum repository, you typically install a ‚Äúrepo‚Äù RPM or manually place a file in `/etc/yum.repos.d/`. Check the baseurl and gpgkey lines. For example, for RHEL/CentOS 9, it might look like:
```ini
[mysql80-community]
name=MySQL 8.0 Community Server
baseurl=https://repo.mysql.com/yum/mysql-8.0-community/el/9/$basearch/
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql-2022
enabled=1
module_hotfixes=1
```
If the baseurl points to `/el/8/` or uses an older GPG key, you‚Äôll get signature errors on new packages. Make sure it‚Äôs explicitly referencing the ‚Äúel/9‚Äù path for MySQL 8.0 if you‚Äôre on AL2023.

---

## 4. Temporarily Disable the GPG Check (Not Recommended Long-Term)

As a last resort (e.g., for testing on a dev instance), you can disable the GPG check in your `.repo` file or on the command line:
```bash
sudo yum install --nogpgcheck mysql-community-server
```
This is **not** recommended for production because it bypasses signature verification. But it can confirm the packages will install if not for the key mismatch. Then you can re-enable and figure out the correct key.

---

## 5. Consider Using MariaDB or Amazon‚Äôs Corretto MySQL

For some workloads, you can use the MariaDB 10.x packages that come built into Amazon Linux 2023. Or if you only need a client, you can install the default ‚Äúdnf install mariadb‚Äù (which provides a mysql-compatible client). If you specifically want Oracle‚Äôs MySQL 8.0, continue with the official MySQL steps above; just know it might be trickier on AL2023 until official support is documented.

---

### Summary of Steps

1. **Confirm** you are using the correct MySQL repository for ‚Äúel9‚Äù or a variant that matches Amazon Linux 2023.  
2. **Remove** any old or incorrect MySQL GPG keys from the system.  
3. **Import** the correct MySQL GPG key again:
   ```bash
   sudo rpm --import https://repo.mysql.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql-2022
   ```
4. **Check** the `.repo` file under `/etc/yum.repos.d/` to ensure the `baseurl` and `gpgkey` lines match your installed key and the ‚Äúel/9‚Äù path (not el/7 or el/8).  
5. Try `sudo yum clean all && sudo yum install mysql-community-server`.  

These steps typically resolve the GPG mismatch error so you can install MySQL 8.0 successfully on Amazon Linux 2023. If the mismatch persists, you may need to confirm that the version of MySQL you want is fully supported on AL2023 or consider an alternative distribution or approach.

## Analysis 

Note: The five LLMs have been anonymized in the analysis below, as follows: ChatGPT-4o is Chatbot #1, Gemini 2.0 Flash is Chatbot #2, Q is Chatbot #3, DeepSeek R1 is Chatbot #4 and ChatGPT-o1 is Chatbot #5

Below is a comparative analysis of each chatbot response against the **baseline answer** from Stack Overflow.

## Baseline Answer (Summary)

The original question is about installing MySQL on an Amazon Linux 2023 instance (AL2023) and encountering a ‚ÄúGPG key‚Äù mismatch / error. The final fix is:

> You need to import the new MySQL GPG key for 2023, specifically:
> 
> ```bash
> rpm --import https://repo.mysql.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql-2023
> ```
> 
> (Notice ‚Äú2023,‚Äù not ‚Äú2022‚Äù). That solves the GPG check failure.

Hence, the baseline answer clarifies that the user was using the old ‚ÄúRPM-GPG-KEY-mysql-2022,‚Äù but for these latest MySQL 8.0.36 packages (especially in AL2023 / RHEL9-based environment), you need the updated ‚Äú2023‚Äù key. That‚Äôs basically the entire fix:  
**Use** `rpm --import https://repo.mysql.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql-2023`, not the older 2022 key.

## Chatbot Response #1

### 1. Accuracy
- #1 claims that Amazon Linux 2023 ‚Äúdoes not support external YUM repositories natively,‚Äù suggesting you should get MySQL from Amazon‚Äôs official repo via `dnf install mysql-server`.  
- The baseline specifically says the fix is to import the GPG-KEY for 2023 from MySQL‚Äôs official. #1‚Äôs main approach is effectively ‚Äúuse the Amazon-provided MySQL package.‚Äù 
- That is a feasible workaround, but the baseline specifically wants to install MySQL from the official MySQL community repo. #1 also mentions an alternative approach with `--nogpgcheck` or removing old keys, but it references `rpm --import https://repo.mysql.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql-2022`. 
- The baseline says you must use the 2023 key, not 2022. #1 doesn‚Äôt mention ‚Äú2023‚Äù key at all. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory** (It‚Äôs not the same solution as the baseline. It does provide a working approach‚Äîjust use AL2023‚Äôs built-in MySQL or forcibly skip GPG‚Äîbut it doesn‚Äôt mention the actual fix of using the ‚Äú2023‚Äù GPG key.)

### 2. Completeness
- The baseline is specifically about the user wanting the MySQL official repo in AL2023. #1 mostly suggests using a different approach or forcibly skipping GPG checks. 
- Missing the mention that the user can fix the mismatch by simply using the new ‚Äú2023‚Äù GPG key. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

### 3. Clarity
- Well structured. 
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

### 4. Practicality
- Tells the user how to do a solution that works (use Amazon‚Äôs MySQL). They do mention forcibly installing from the official MySQL repo with `--nogpgcheck`. They never mention the actual baseline fix: ‚ÄúImport the 2023 key.‚Äù 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #1)**: **Partially Satisfactory**

## Chatbot Response #2

### 1. Accuracy
- #2 discusses general troubleshooting steps: cleaning yum cache, ensuring correct repos, verifying the GPG key. 
- The baseline specifically wants you to use the 2023 key. #2 only references the ‚ÄúmySQL 80 community release el9‚Äù repo and says you might need ‚Äúthe correct key.‚Äù But it shows an example using `rpm --import https://repo.mysql.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql-2022`? Actually, it says in a snippet ‚Äú(If the key URL in the repository file is different from the one you previously imported, import the correct key).‚Äù 
- However, it doesn‚Äôt specifically mention ‚Äú2023.‚Äù 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory** (It‚Äôs close to the general approach, but doesn‚Äôt highlight that you must use the ‚Äú2023‚Äù key.)

### 2. Completeness
- The baseline says the direct fix is to import `RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql-2023`. #2 says ‚ÄúIf the key is different, import it,‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt specifically mention ‚Äú2023.‚Äù 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

### 3. Clarity
- Reasonably clear instructions for verifying the repo config, but no direct mention of the 2023 key. 
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

### 4. Practicality
- Feasible steps, yes, but omits the direct mention that the user needs the ‚Äú2023‚Äù key. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #2)**: **Partially Satisfactory**

### 1. Accuracy
- Tells the user to fix the MySQL repo config, re-import the GPG key from ‚Äú2022.‚Äù 
- The baseline specifically says the user needs the ‚Äú2023‚Äù key. #4 references ‚Äúhttps://repo.mysql.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql-2022.‚Äù 
- That is the older key. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory** (like #2, it‚Äôs the general approach, but not the correct ‚Äú2023‚Äù key.)

### 2. Completeness
- Doesn‚Äôt mention you specifically need ‚Äú2023.‚Äù 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

### 3. Clarity
- Nicely structured. 
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

### 4. Practicality
- Tells you how to do it with the older 2022 key. That might not solve the user‚Äôs problem. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #4)**: **Partially Satisfactory**

**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

### 3. Clarity
- Very thorough and structured. 
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

### 4. Practicality
- The instructions are quite practical for general GPG mismatch. However, the user specifically needed ‚Äú2023.‚Äù 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #5)**: **Partially Satisfactory**

---

# Summary

**Baseline**: The user must import the ‚Äú2023‚Äù GPG key from `https://repo.mysql.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql-2023`.  

**All** chatbots talk about general solutions (import GPG key, check repos, remove old keys). But none specifically mention the ‚Äú2023‚Äù key from the baseline. Instead they keep referencing the 2022 key or alternative approaches.  

**Accuracy**: None precisely states the fix that the baseline states (importing the ‚Äú2023‚Äù key). All are partially correct in general but do not mention the correct key the user needs.  

**Completeness**: All omit the explicit mention that the user needs that ‚Äú2023‚Äù key. They are thus partially complete.  

**Clarity**: They‚Äôre all generally well structured except #3 is presumably truncated.  

**Practicality**: Because they don‚Äôt mention the ‚Äú2023‚Äù key, they might not solve the user‚Äôs problem. So they‚Äôre partial.

## Overall Best Response

They‚Äôre all missing the direct mention of ‚Äú2023‚Äù key, so none are fully correct. #1 suggests installing MySQL from Amazon‚Äôs official repo as a workaround, which might solve the user‚Äôs problem but not in the same manner. Possibly #2 or #5 is the most thorough about the general approach. Let‚Äôs pick **#5** as the best overall because it‚Äôs quite thorough. 

## Overall Worst Response

**Response #3** is truncated or missing, so that‚Äôs the worst.

**Answer Key**:  
- Best: #5 (though not perfect)  
- Worst: #3 (incomplete/truncated)
