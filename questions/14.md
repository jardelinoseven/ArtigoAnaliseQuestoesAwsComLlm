## [Question 14](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75216718/trying-to-convert-json-to-string-athena-aws)

Trying to convert json to string (Athena AWS)

I have a json formatted like: `myjson = {"key":["value1","value2"]}` and a I want to convert it as string
Sometime this json can return null: `myjson = {"key":null}` .

I want to get the values as a string, but I get an error when I try to cast `cast(json_extract(myjson,'$.key') as varchar)`. The error says that is not possible to convert '["value1","value2"]' to varchar. I think it is because of the double quote. I need help to work around this problem.

Edit1:

- The output of json_extract(myjson,'$.key') is a json object;
- I want to get a string like 'value1, value2' or 'null'
- At the moment I do not know how to verify if it is null or not


## Highest-scored answer 

You can use `json_format` (though depending on the following usage leaving just 
`json_extract` without cast/format/etc. can be fine in some cases):

```sql
-- sample data
with dataset(json_str) as (
  values ('{"key":["value1","value2"]}'),
         ('{"key":null}')
)

-- query
select json_format(json_extract(json_str,'$.key'))
from dataset;
```


Output:

_col0

["value1","value2"]

null


Another option is casting the result of `json_extract` to `array(varchar)` and using array_join on it (see this answer for example).


## ChatGPT 4o

To achieve the desired result of converting JSON array values to a comma-separated string in AWS Athena, you can use a combination of `json_extract`, `json_array_get`, and `regexp_replace` functions. Here’s a step-by-step guide to handle both cases (array of values and null values):

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Extract JSON Array**: Use `json_extract` to get the JSON array from the JSON object.
2. **Handle Null Values**: Check if the extracted value is null.
3. **Convert JSON Array to String**: Convert the JSON array to a comma-separated string if it’s not null.

### Query to Handle JSON Conversion

```sql
WITH data AS (
    SELECT 
        '{"key":["value1","value2"]}' AS myjson
    UNION ALL
        SELECT '{"key":null}' AS myjson
)
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN json_extract(myjson, '$.key') IS NULL THEN 'null'
        ELSE regexp_replace(
            regexp_replace(
                regexp_replace(
                    CAST(json_extract(myjson, '$.key') AS varchar), 
                    '^\[', ''
                ), 
                '\]$', ''
            ), 
            '"', ''
        )
    END AS extracted_values
FROM data;
```

### Explanation:

1. **Extract JSON Key**:
   - `json_extract(myjson, '$.key')` extracts the value of `key` from the JSON object.
   
2. **Handle Null Values**:
   - `CASE WHEN json_extract(myjson, '$.key') IS NULL THEN 'null'` checks if the extracted value is null and returns 'null'.
   
3. **Convert JSON Array to Comma-Separated String**:
   - `CAST(json_extract(myjson, '$.key') AS varchar)` converts the JSON array to a string representation.
   - The nested `regexp_replace` functions clean up the string by:
     - Removing the opening bracket `[`.
     - Removing the closing bracket `]`.
     - Removing the double quotes `"` from the values.

### Handling Nested Data and Complex Structures

If your JSON structure is more complex, you may need to adjust the regular expressions or use additional JSON functions to handle nested arrays or objects. However, the provided solution should work for the specified problem of converting a JSON array to a comma-separated string.

By using this approach, you can ensure that both arrays and null values are handled correctly, resulting in a clean string output suitable for further processing or reporting in Athena.


## ChatGPT-4

In AWS Athena, you are facing issues with converting JSON to string format, especially when handling arrays and null values within JSON objects. Athena's SQL dialect and functions can handle this but require careful manipulation of JSON and conditional logic. Here’s how you can address your requirements:

### Steps to Extract JSON Values as Strings in Athena

1. **Use `json_extract` Function**: You've correctly started by extracting the JSON object using the `json_extract` function. However, since `json_extract` returns a JSON-typed object, directly casting it to `varchar` will not handle arrays correctly.

2. **Transform JSON Array to String**: To transform a JSON array into a comma-separated string and handle the null case, you can use a combination of JSON functions and conditional statements. Here is a sample query that can do this:

    ```sql
    SELECT
      CASE 
        WHEN json_extract(myjson, '$.key') IS NULL THEN 'null'
        WHEN cardinality(json_parse(json_extract(myjson, '$.key'))) = 0 THEN ''
        ELSE array_join(transform(cast(json_parse(json_extract(myjson, '$.key')) as array<varchar>), x -> x), ', ')
      END AS extracted_values
    FROM your_table_name
    ```

    **Explanation**:
    - `json_parse(json_extract(myjson, '$.key'))`: Parses the JSON object from the extracted key.
    - `cast(... as array<varchar>)`: Casts the JSON array to an array of `varchar`.
    - `transform(...)`: Uses the `transform` function to process each element (if needed, here just passing through).
    - `array_join(...)`: Joins the array elements into a single string separated by commas.
    - `CASE WHEN`: Handles cases where the JSON key is null or the array is empty.

3. **Check for Null Values**: The query already includes a `CASE` statement to check if the JSON object is null or the extracted array is empty, addressing your concern about handling nulls.

### Additional Considerations

- **Test on Different JSON Structures**: Since JSON structures can be quite diverse, test this solution on various JSON inputs to ensure it behaves as expected across different data scenarios.
- **Optimization**: If the query becomes a part of a larger, more complex query, consider performance implications, especially if operating on large datasets.
- **Handling Non-Array JSON Values**: If some records could have non-array values (e.g., a single integer or string instead of an array), additional logic might be needed to handle these cases without errors.

This solution should help you transform JSON arrays into a comma-separated string format in Athena while also handling potential null values effectively.


## Gemini

The AWS user is encountering an issue converting a JSON array extracted from Athena to a single string. Here are a couple of approaches to address this:
1. Using json_pretty and Substring Extraction:
This approach leverages json_pretty to format the JSON array as a string and then extracts the desired values using substrings:
SQL
SELECT
  CASE WHEN json_extract(myjson, '$.key') IS NULL THEN 'null'
  ELSE SUBSTRING(json_pretty(json_extract(myjson, '$.key')), 17) -- Remove brackets
  END AS string_value
FROM your_table;


Explanation:
json_extract(myjson, '$.key') extracts the value for the "key" field.
CASE statement checks for null values.
If null, it returns the string "null".
If not null, it uses json_pretty to format the extracted JSON array as a human-readable string.
SUBSTRING extracts the desired content (values) by removing the leading square brackets ([ ]) from the formatted string. The starting position (17) accounts for characters before the actual values.
2. Using json_array_elements and Concatenation:
This approach iterates through the JSON array elements using json_array_elements and concatenates them into a single string:
SQL
SELECT
  CASE WHEN json_extract(myjson, '$.key') IS NULL THEN 'null'
  ELSE COALESCE(
    wm_concat(value SEPARATOR ', ') OVER (PARTITION BY myjson ORDER BY value),
    ''
  )
  END AS string_value
FROM your_table,
UNNEST(json_extract(myjson, '$.key')) AS value;


Explanation:
Similar to the first approach, the CASE statement checks for null values.
If null, it returns "null".
If not null, it uses UNNEST to create a temporary table with each element of the JSON array as a separate row.
wm_concat with SEPARATOR, iterates through the unnested rows, concatenating the values with a comma (", ") in between.
COALESCE ensures an empty string ("") is returned if there are no elements in the array.
Choosing the Right Approach:
Both approaches achieve the desired outcome. Choose the one that best suits your needs and coding style.
Consider potential performance implications if dealing with very large JSON arrays.
Additional Notes:
Adjust the SUBSTRING starting position in the first approach if the structure of your JSON before the values changes.
Ensure proper handling of potential special characters within the values when using string concatenation.
By implementing one of these approaches, the AWS user can successfully convert the JSON array extracted from Athena to a single string representation, handling both cases with and without values.


## Q

To convert the JSON data to a string in Athena, you can try the following approaches:

1. Use the `json_extract_scalar()` function:
   ```sql
   SELECT json_extract_scalar(myjson, '$.key') AS key_as_string
   FROM your_table;
   ```
   This function will return the value as a string, handling both non-null and null values. For null values, it will return `'null'`.

2. Use a combination of `json_extract()` and `cast()`:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     CASE 
       WHEN json_extract(myjson, '$.key') IS NULL THEN 'null'
       ELSE cast(json_extract(myjson, '$.key') AS varchar)
     END AS key_as_string
   FROM your_table;
   ```
   This approach first checks if the value is null, and if so, returns the string `'null'`. Otherwise, it casts the extracted value to a varchar.

3. Use the `regexp_replace()` function to remove the square brackets and double quotes:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     regexp_replace(cast(json_extract(myjson, '$.key') AS varchar), '[""]', '') AS key_as_string
   FROM your_table;
   ```
   This will remove the square brackets and double quotes from the extracted value, resulting in a comma-separated string.

The key points to consider are:

- Use `json_extract_scalar()` or a combination of `json_extract()` and `cast()` to handle both non-null and null values.
- Use `regexp_replace()` to remove the square brackets and double quotes if needed.
- Refer to the AWS documentation for the latest information on Athena's JSON-related functions and capabilities.
