AWS IAM Identity Center Configuration using terraform

4

I am new to terraform. I was experimenting with AWS IAM Identity Center, but could not find a solution.

Context - I have a directory service - example.com and Active Directory on EC2 (domain join completed) with my users and groups.(Achieved this with terraform till this point). Now I want to bring those users and groups into the AWS IAM Identity center and create new permission sets and assign them to the AWS accounts.

Goal - I want to setup and configure AWS IAM Identity Center, and work on the importing/sync of users and groups from the AWS directory service and create permission sets and assign them to the account, all with terraform.

As of writing this answer on 4 Jan 2024, there are currently limited operations that we can perform using Terraform. Unfortunately, if you want to set up the AWS SSO ( IAM Identity Center ), you must start the process manually using the ClickOps (aka AWS Console) approach. To do so, you will need to follow the steps below:

Login to your root admin account
Select primary region
Go to __IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On)__
Click on the orange __Enable__ button
From there on, you will be able to use Terraform to setup the following resources:

1. AWS SSO Admin
aws_ssoadmin_account_assignment
aws_ssoadmin_application
aws_ssoadmin_application_assignment
aws_ssoadmin_application_assignment_configuration
aws_ssoadmin_customer_managed_policy_attachment
aws_ssoadmin_instance_access_control_attributes
aws_ssoadmin_managed_policy_attachment
aws_ssoadmin_permission_set
aws_ssoadmin_permission_set_inline_policy
aws_ssoadmin_permissions_boundary_attachment
aws_ssoadmin_trusted_token_issuer

2. AWS SSO Identity Store
aws_identitystore_group
aws_identitystore_group_membership
aws_identitystore_user

Configuring AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO) using Terraform involves several steps. You'll need to set up the AWS IAM Identity Center, sync users and groups from AWS Directory Service, create permission sets, and assign them to your AWS accounts. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Install Terraform and Required Providers
Ensure you have Terraform installed and the AWS provider configured.

#### 2. Define Your Terraform Configuration
Create a Terraform configuration file to set up the AWS IAM Identity Center and related resources.

```hcl
# main.tf
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_ssoadmin_instance" "example" {}

resource "aws_directory_service_directory" "example" {
  name     = "example.com"
  password = "SuperSecretPassw0rd"
  size     = "Small"
  vpc_settings {
    vpc_id     = aws_vpc.example.id
    subnet_ids = [aws_subnet.example1.id, aws_subnet.example2.id]
  }
}

resource "aws_ssoadmin_permission_set" "example" {
  instance_arn = aws_ssoadmin_instance.example.arn
  name         = "ExamplePermissionSet"

  session_duration    = "PT1H"
  relay_state         = "https://aws.amazon.com/"
  tags = {
    "Purpose" = "Example"
  }
}

resource "aws_ssoadmin_managed_policy_attachment" "example" {
  instance_arn      = aws_ssoadmin_instance.example.arn
  permission_set_arn = aws_ssoadmin_permission_set.example.arn
  managed_policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess"
}

resource "aws_ssoadmin_account_assignment" "example" {
  instance_arn        = aws_ssoadmin_instance.example.arn
  permission_set_arn  = aws_ssoadmin_permission_set.example.arn
  principal_id        = aws_directory_service_directory.example.directory_id
  principal_type      = "USER"
  target_id           = aws_organizations_account.example.id
  target_type         = "AWS_ACCOUNT"
}

# Example VPC, Subnets, and Organizations Account (for context, replace with your actual resources)
resource "aws_vpc" "example" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

resource "aws_subnet" "example1" {
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.example.id
  cidr_block        = "10.0.1.0/24"
  availability_zone = "us-west-2a"
}

resource "aws_subnet" "example2" {
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.example.id
  cidr_block        = "10.0.2.0/24"
  availability_zone = "us-west-2b"
}

resource "aws_organizations_account" "example" {
  name      = "example-account"
  email     = "example-account@example.com"
  role_name = "OrganizationAccountAccessRole"
}
```

### Explanation of Resources

1. **aws_ssoadmin_instance**: Defines the AWS IAM Identity Center instance.
2. **aws_directory_service_directory**: Creates an AWS Directory Service directory.
3. **aws_ssoadmin_permission_set**: Creates a permission set in IAM Identity Center.
4. **aws_ssoadmin_managed_policy_attachment**: Attaches a managed policy to the permission set.
5. **aws_ssoadmin_account_assignment**: Assigns the permission set to a user in an AWS account.

#### 3. Apply the Terraform Configuration
Run the following commands to apply your Terraform configuration:

```sh
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

This will set up the AWS IAM Identity Center, sync users and groups from AWS Directory Service, create permission sets, and assign them to your AWS accounts.

### Note:
1. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create these resources in your AWS account.
2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual resource identifiers and configuration details.
3. The setup of `aws_directory_service_directory` assumes you have a VPC and subnets already created.

By following these steps, you should be able to configure AWS IAM Identity Center and manage users, groups, and permissions using Terraform.


## ChatGPT-4

To achieve your goal of setting up and configuring AWS IAM Identity Center using Terraform, and managing the import/sync of users and groups from AWS Directory Service into IAM Identity Center, there are several steps you will need to take. As of now, Terraform's support for AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO) includes creating permission sets and assigning them, but does not fully support the initial setup of the IAM Identity Center or the direct synchronization of users and groups from a directory service.

Here’s a breakdown of the steps you can take using Terraform and where you might need to supplement with manual configurations or scripting:

### Step 1: Set Up AWS IAM Identity Center
Currently, the initial setup of IAM Identity Center must be done through the AWS Management Console or using AWS CLI. This includes configuring IAM Identity Center to integrate with your AWS Directory Service (either AWS Managed Microsoft AD or AD Connector).

### Step 2: Define Permission Sets in Terraform
Once IAM Identity Center is set up, you can define permission sets using Terraform. Here’s how you can define a permission set:

```hcl
resource "aws_ssoadmin_permission_set" "example_permission_set" {
  instance_arn = "arn:aws:sso:::instance/${var.sso_instance_arn}"
  name         = "ExamplePermissionSet"

  session_duration = "PT2H"
}
```

### Step 3: Assign Permission Sets to Accounts
After creating permission sets, you can assign them to user groups within specific accounts using Terraform:

```hcl
resource "aws_ssoadmin_account_assignment" "example_assignment" {
  instance_arn       = "arn:aws:sso:::instance/${var.sso_instance_arn}"
  permission_set_arn = aws_ssoadmin_permission_set.example_permission_set.arn
  principal_type     = "GROUP"
  principal_id       = var.group_id  # This should be the ID of the group in IAM Identity Center
  target_id          = var.account_id  # AWS Account ID
  target_type        = "AWS_ACCOUNT"
}
```

### Step 4: Syncing Users and Groups
Terraform does not currently support the synchronization of users and groups from Directory Services to IAM Identity Center. This synchronization needs to be set up either through the AWS Management Console or automated using AWS CLI or API scripts.

For instance, using AWS CLI, you might need to trigger synchronization or check synchronization status. However, detailed CLI commands or API calls for these actions are typically not required once the sync is initially configured via the AWS Console.

### Additional Considerations
- **Directory Integration**: Ensure that your directory (AWS Managed Microsoft AD or AD Connector) is correctly integrated and functioning with IAM Identity Center before attempting to sync users and groups.
- **Terraform State Management**: Terraform manages state locally or in a remote backend. Be cautious with manual changes in the AWS Console, as they can lead to state discrepancies.

### Example Script for Sync Status (Optional)
If you need to check the sync status or manage directory users/groups via scripting, consider using AWS SDKs or CLI in scripts that can be triggered from your local machine or CI/CD pipelines:

```bash
aws sso-admin list-instances
aws sso-admin list-directory-associations --instance-arn "arn:aws:sso:::instance/<instance-id>"
```

### Conclusion
While Terraform can automate much of the resource provisioning and configuration in AWS, some features like the initial setup and user synchronization for IAM Identity Center might require manual intervention or scripting. Keep your Terraform scripts and AWS environment in sync to avoid configuration drift and ensure that your infrastructure as code reflects your actual AWS settings.

Unfortunately, Terraform currently (as of May 29, 2024) doesn't have direct support for managing AWS IAM Identity Center (IAM IC) resources. However, you can still leverage Terraform for some aspects of your goal and potentially work around limitations for others:
What Terraform Can Do:
AWS Directory Service: Terraform can manage the creation and configuration of your AWS Directory Service (example.com) using the aws_directory_service resource.
IAM Roles and Permissions: Terraform can manage IAM roles and permission sets for your AWS accounts using the aws_iam_role and aws_iam_permission_set resources.
Workarounds for IAM IC Configuration:
Manual Configuration: You can configure IAM IC manually through the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI. Terraform can then manage the IAM roles and permission sets associated with your users and groups in IAM IC.
AWS Provider with API Calls: While not officially supported, you might explore using the aws provider with direct API calls to manage some limited IAM IC functionality. However, this approach is complex, not officially documented, and subject to changes in the API. It's recommended to proceed with caution if you choose this route.
Steps for a Terraform-based Approach:
Manage Directory Service: Use Terraform to manage your existing AWS Directory Service (example.com) configuration.
Manual IAM IC Setup: Set up IAM IC through the AWS Management Console or CLI, linking it to your directory service.
Terraform for IAM Roles and Permissions: Use Terraform to define IAM roles and permission sets within your AWS accounts. You can reference these roles and permissions when assigning them to users and groups within IAM IC manually.
Alternative Approach (Consider if applicable):
If your primary goal is to manage user access across multiple AWS accounts using centralized groups and permissions, consider using AWS SSO (Single Sign-On). Terraform has better support for managing AWS SSO resources compared to IAM IC.
Additional Notes:
Keep an eye on Terraform documentation for future updates as IAM IC support might be added in the future.
Use AWS documentation for IAM IC and IAM roles/permissions to understand configuration options.
By combining Terraform with manual IAM IC configuration or potentially exploring unsupported AWS provider API calls (use with caution), you can achieve some aspects of your goal. However, the ideal solution depends on your specific requirements and risk tolerance. If managing user access across accounts is the core objective, evaluate AWS SSO as a potential alternative with better Terraform support.


## Q

To configure AWS IAM Identity Center using Terraform, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set up the AWS provider in Terraform**: Start by configuring the AWS provider in your Terraform code, specifying the necessary credentials and region.

2. **Create the IAM Identity Center directory**: Use the `aws_identitystore_directory` resource to create the IAM Identity Center directory. You'll need to provide the directory name and other required attributes.

3. **Configure the identity source**: If you want to use your existing Active Directory as the identity source, you'll need to configure the `aws_identitystore_directory_integration` resource. This will allow you to connect your Active Directory to the IAM Identity Center directory.

   ```hcl
   resource "aws_identitystore_directory_integration" "example" {
     directory_id = aws_identitystore_directory.example.id
     type         = "ACTIVE_DIRECTORY"
     config {
       access_role_arn = aws_iam_role.example.arn
       directory_id    = aws_directory_service_directory.example.id
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Create permission sets**: Use the `aws_identitystore_permission_set` resource to define the permission sets that you want to assign to your users and groups.

5. **Assign permission sets to AWS accounts**: Use the `aws_ssoadmin_permission_set_assignment` resource to assign the permission sets to your AWS accounts.

6. **Sync users and groups**: If you're using an external identity source like Active Directory, you'll need to set up user and group synchronization. You can use the `aws_identitystore_user` and `aws_identitystore_group` resources to manage the synchronization.

   ```hcl
   resource "aws_identitystore_user" "example" {
     directory_id = aws_identitystore_directory.example.id
     user_name    = "example_user"
     display_name = "Example User"
   }
   ```

7. **Assign users and groups to permission sets**: Use the `aws_ssoadmin_account_assignment` resource to assign users and groups to the permission sets you created earlier.

Remember to refer to the latest AWS documentation for the most up-to-date information on IAM Identity Center configuration and Terraform resources. The Terraform AWS provider documentation is a good starting point for learning how to use Terraform with AWS services.
