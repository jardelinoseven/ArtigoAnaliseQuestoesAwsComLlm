Amazon Bedrock Agent - Access denied when calling Bedrock. Check your request permissions and retry the request

I'm building an agent using AWS Bedrock, I have created a knowledge base and allowed AWS bedrock to configure access policies. 

When I try to invoke the Agent I get the following error: `Access denied when calling Bedrock. Check your request permissions and retry the request.`

I have tried setting IAM permissions to `AdministratorAccess` for the service role.


Further, I have added these inline policies in addition to the AWS defined policies + Administrator access

```
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "Statement1",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": [
				"bedrock:InvokeModel",
				"bedrock:*",
				"bedrock:QueryKnowledgeBase",
				"bedrock:Retrieve",
				"bedrock:RetrieveAndGenerate"
			],
			"Resource": [
				"arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-v2",
				"arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-instant-v1",
				"arn:aws:bedrock:*:389743002678:knowledge-base/:knowledge-base-id"
			]
		},
		{
			"Sid": "Statement2",
			"Effect": "Allow",

			]
		}
	]
}
```


## Baseline answer 

It was an issue with access to the â€˜Anthropicâ€™ models. Please make sure that you submit a use case and get access to the models. You will be granted access usually within a few hours.

### **Fixing "Access denied when calling Bedrock" Error in AWS Bedrock Agent**

Your **AWS Bedrock Agent** is failing due to **IAM permission issues**, even though you have given **AdministratorAccess** and additional inline policies.

---

## **Possible Causes & Fixes**
### **1. Verify IAM Role Assigned to the Bedrock Agent**
AWS Bedrock Agents **use a specific execution role**. Ensure that the correct **IAM role is assigned** to the agent.

#### **Fix: Check the Role Assigned to Your Agent**
1. **Go to AWS Console â†’ Bedrock â†’ Agents**
2. Click on your **Agent**.
3. Scroll to **Execution Role ARN**.
4. Copy the IAM role ARN and verify that it includes the correct permissions.

âœ… **If the role is missing permissions, attach the correct policies**.

---

### **2. Update IAM Role with Correct Permissions**
Even though you've assigned `AdministratorAccess`, AWS **sometimes restricts Bedrock agent roles from assuming certain permissions**.

#### **Fix: Attach the Required Policies**
Modify your IAM role and explicitly **add Bedrock permissions**.

### **Minimal Required Policy for Bedrock Agents**
Replace your current policy with this:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "bedrock:InvokeModel",
                "bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream",
                "bedrock:Retrieve",
                "bedrock:RetrieveAndGenerate",
                "bedrock:QueryKnowledgeBase",
                "bedrock:ListFoundationModels",
                "bedrock:GetFoundationModel",
                "bedrock:ListCustomModels"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:PassRole"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "iam:PassedToService": "bedrock.amazonaws.com"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

âœ… **Why?**
- **Fixes missing `bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream`**.
- **Ensures access to Bedrock foundation models**.
- **Allows role to interact with S3 if using knowledge bases**.
- **Enables passing IAM roles to Bedrock Agents**.

---

### **3. Ensure Correct Region for Bedrock Permissions**
AWS Bedrock **is only available in certain regions**. If you're using **IAM policies with hardcoded ARNs**, ensure the region **matches your deployment**.

#### **Fix: Check Region in Your Policy**
Your current policy has:
```json
"Resource": [
    "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-v2",
    "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-instant-v1"
]
```

If your Bedrock Agent is in a different region (e.g., **`us-west-2`**), update these ARNs accordingly or use:
```json
"Resource": "*"
```

âœ… **Why?**  
- Hardcoded region ARNs can cause **permission mismatches**.
- **Use `"Resource": "*"` to allow flexibility**.

---

### **4. Validate Bedrock Agent Execution Role**
AWS Bedrock requires **IAM roles with correct trust relationships**.

#### **Fix: Ensure the Trust Policy Allows Bedrock to Assume the Role**
Check your **IAM Trust Policy**:
1. **Go to AWS IAM Console â†’ Roles**.
2. Find the **role assigned to your Bedrock Agent**.
3. Click **"Trust relationships"** and ensure it contains:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "bedrock.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```

âœ… **Why?**
- Without this, **Bedrock cannot assume the role**.

---

### **5. Verify API Call Details in CloudTrail**
If issues persist, check AWS **CloudTrail** for permission errors.

#### **Fix: Check CloudTrail Logs**
1. **Go to AWS Console â†’ CloudTrail**.
2. **Look for `AccessDenied` events in `bedrock:InvokeModel`**.
3. Identify which IAM role is being used and missing permissions.

âœ… **Why?**
- CloudTrail **pinpoints exact permission failures**.

---

## **Final Checklist**
| Issue | Solution |
|------|---------|
| **Incorrect IAM Role Assigned to Agent** | Check **execution role in AWS Bedrock Console** |
| **Missing `InvokeModelWithResponseStream` Permission** | Add **`bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream`** to IAM policy |
| **IAM Role Lacks Trust Policy** | Ensure **Bedrock (`bedrock.amazonaws.com`) can assume the role** |
| **Hardcoded Region Mismatch** | Use **`"Resource": "*"`** or match Bedrock region |
| **Need Debugging Information** | Check **CloudTrail logs for permission errors** |

---

### **Final Steps to Fix the Issue**
1. **Check the IAM role assigned to your Bedrock Agent**.
2. **Attach the updated IAM policy with correct Bedrock permissions**.
3. **Ensure the IAM trust policy allows Bedrock to assume the role**.
4. **Verify API calls in CloudTrail for permission failures**.
5. **Try invoking the Bedrock Agent again**.

ðŸš€ After applying these fixes, your Bedrock Agent should work without **Access Denied** errors. Let me know if you need further debugging! âœ…

## Gemini

The user is encountering an "Access denied" error when invoking an Amazon Bedrock Agent, despite granting extensive IAM permissions, including `AdministratorAccess` and specific inline policies. The error suggests that the Agent's service role lacks the necessary permissions to call Bedrock services or access the knowledge base.

Here's a breakdown of the problem and potential solutions:

**Understanding the Problem:**

* **Bedrock Agent Service Role:**
    * Agents in Amazon Bedrock use a service role to interact with other AWS services, including Bedrock models and knowledge bases.
    * The error indicates that this role is missing the required permissions.
* **Overly Broad Permissions:**
    * While `AdministratorAccess` and broad wildcard permissions (`bedrock:*`, `s3:*`, `Resource: "*"`) might seem to solve the issue, they can sometimes mask the underlying problem or introduce security risks.
    * It is always best to grant only the needed permissions.
* **Specific Resource ARNs:**
    * The user has attempted to add specific ARNs for foundation models and the knowledge base, which is a good step. However, there might be other missing permissions.
* **Knowledge Base Permissions:**
    * Even if the service role has Bedrock permissions, it might lack permissions to access the specific knowledge base or the underlying data source (e.g., S3 bucket).
* **Agent Permissions:**
    * There are agent specific permissions that are needed.

**Solutions:**

1.  **Verify the Agent's Service Role:**

    * Confirm the exact IAM role that the Bedrock Agent is using.
    * In the Bedrock console, navigate to your Agent and check its configuration for the service role.
    * Ensure that the IAM policies are attached to the correct role.

2.  **Refine IAM Policies:**

    * Instead of relying on `AdministratorAccess`, use more specific IAM policies.
    * **Agent Permissions:**
        * Ensure that the service role has the following permissions:
            * `bedrock-agent-runtime:InvokeAgent`
            * `bedrock-agent-runtime:RetrieveAndGenerate`
            * `bedrock-agent-runtime:Retrieve`
            * `bedrock:QueryKnowledgeBase`
            * `bedrock:InvokeModel`
        * Also, ensure the role has permissions for any tools that the agent uses.
    * **Knowledge Base Permissions:**
        * Verify that the service role has permissions to access the knowledge base:
            * `bedrock:QueryKnowledgeBase`
            * `bedrock:Retrieve`
            * `bedrock:RetrieveAndGenerate`
        * If the knowledge base uses an S3 bucket as its data source, ensure the service role has the necessary S3 read permissions.
            * `s3:GetObject`
            * `s3:ListBucket`
        * Replace `:knowledge-base-id` in your resource arn with the actual knowledge base id.
    * **Foundation Model Permissions:**
        * Ensure that the service role has `bedrock:InvokeModel` permission for the specific foundation models used by the Agent.
        * It is best practice to only give invoke model permissions for the specific models that the agent will use.
    * **Remove Wildcard Permissions:**
        * Remove the overly broad wildcard permissions (`bedrock:*`, `s3:*`, `Resource: "*"`) from your inline policies.
        * This will allow for better security, and allow you to pinpoint the exact missing permission.

3.  **Check Knowledge Base Configuration:**

    * Verify that the knowledge base is correctly configured and accessible.
    * Ensure that the data source (e.g., S3 bucket) is accessible and contains the necessary data.
    * Ensure that the knowledge base has been correctly synced.

4.  **Review CloudTrail Logs:**

    * Use AWS CloudTrail to examine the API calls made by the Agent.
    * CloudTrail logs can provide detailed information about access denied errors, including the specific actions and resources involved.
    * This will allow you to see the exact permission that is missing.

5.  **Test with Minimal Permissions:**

    * Create a new IAM role with minimal permissions and gradually add permissions until the Agent works.
    * This can help you identify the precise permissions required.

6.  **Region:**

    * Ensure that all resources are in the same region.

**Example IAM Policy (Refined):**

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "bedrock-agent-runtime:InvokeAgent",
                "bedrock-agent-runtime:RetrieveAndGenerate",
                "bedrock-agent-runtime:Retrieve",
                "bedrock:QueryKnowledgeBase",
                "bedrock:InvokeModel"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1:account-id:agent/*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "bedrock:QueryKnowledgeBase",
                "bedrock:Retrieve",
                "bedrock:RetrieveAndGenerate"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1:account-id:knowledge-base/knowledge-base-id"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "bedrock:InvokeModel",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-v2",
                "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-instant-v1"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-knowledge-base-bucket",
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-knowledge-base-bucket/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

**Replace placeholders:**

* `account-id` with your AWS account ID.
* `knowledge-base-id` with your knowledge base ID.
* `your-knowledge-base-bucket` with your S3 bucket name.

By following these steps, the user can identify and resolve the permission issue.

To resolve the **"Access denied when calling Bedrock"** error for your Bedrock Agent, follow these steps:

---

### **1. Fix the Service Role Permissions**
#### Core Bedrock Permissions:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "BedrockAgentKnowledgeBaseAccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "bedrock:InvokeModel",
                "bedrock:Retrieve",
                "bedrock:RetrieveAndGenerate",
                "bedrock:QueryKnowledgeBase"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                // Allow specific models
                "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-v2",
                "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-instant-v1",
                // Allow knowledge base access (replace placeholders)
                "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1:YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:knowledge-base/YOUR_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "S3BucketAccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_S3_BUCKET/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_S3_BUCKET"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "KMSDecrypt",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "kms:Decrypt",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:key/YOUR_KMS_KEY_ID"
        }
    ]
}
```

---

### **2. Add OpenSearch Serverless Permissions (If Used)**
If your knowledge base uses OpenSearch Serverless:
```json
{
    "Sid": "OpenSearchAccess",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "aoss:APIAccessAll"
    ],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:aoss:us-east-1:YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:collection/YOUR_OPENSEARCH_COLLECTION_ID"
}
```

---

### **3. Verify Trust Relationships**
Ensure your service role trusts the Bedrock service:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "bedrock.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### **4. Enable Bedrock Model Access**
1. Go to **AWS Bedrock Console â†’ Model Access**  
2. Request access to the Claude models (if not already granted).

---

### **5. Validate Knowledge Base Resource Policy**
In the knowledge base settings:
1. Ensure the resource policy allows your agentâ€™s role:
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:role/YOUR_BEDROCK_AGENT_ROLE"
         },
         "Action": [
           "bedrock:Retrieve",
           "bedrock:QueryKnowledgeBase"
         ],
         "Resource": "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1:YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:knowledge-base/YOUR_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

---

### **6. Troubleshooting Steps**
1. **Test Permissions Locally**:
   ```bash
   aws bedrock retrieve \
     --knowledge-base-id YOUR_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID \
     --retrievalQuery '{"text":"Test query"}' \
     --region us-east-1
   ```
2. **Check CloudTrail Logs** for detailed access denial reasons.

---

### **Key Fixes Summary**
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Missing Bedrock model permissions | Explicitly allow `bedrock:InvokeModel` on model ARNs |
| Knowledge base ARN typo | Use exact ARN with account ID and knowledge base ID |
| S3 bucket access | Add `s3:GetObject` and `s3:ListBucket` |
| KMS encryption | Grant `kms:Decrypt` on the S3 bucketâ€™s KMS key |
| Trust relationship | Allow `bedrock.amazonaws.com` to assume the role |

By addressing these areas, the "Access denied" error should resolve. Let me know if you need further clarification! ðŸš€
