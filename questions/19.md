## [Question 19 (Sep 14, 2024)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78984796/insert-missing-rows-in-time-series-consumption-history)

Insert missing rows in time series consumption history

I'm looking for assistance with writing a PostgreSQL query in Apache Superset.

I have metered consumption data, where the meters have unique IDs. Normally, a meter is read at the start of every hour, and the difference is calculated in the consumption column. There are times, however, when an error occurs and the meter is not read, leading to missing hours in the data. I would like to add new rows and create a new column that would say "Missing Data" in those cases.

Here is an example of what the data looks like. The read_time_locals are in a timestamp without timezone format

| meter_id | start_read_time_local | end_read_time_local | start_read | end_read | consumption |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1111 | 9/10/2024 0:00 | 9/10/2024 1:00 | 79118.91 | 79118.93 | 0.02 |
| 1111 | 9/10/2024 3:00 | 9/10/2024 4:00 | 79122.47 | 79123.99 | 1.52 |
| 2222 | 9/10/2024 0:00 | 9/10/2024 1:00 | 1937135 | 1937174 | 39 |
| 2222 | 9/10/2024 1:00 | 9/10/2024 2:00 | 1937174 | 1937191 | 17 |
| 2222 | 9/10/2024 2:00 | 9/10/2024 3:00 | 1937191 | 1937197 | 6 |
| 2222 | 9/10/2024 3:00 | 9/10/2024 4:00 | 1937197 | 1937202 | 5 |

What I would like is to create a query that would do this:

| meter_id | start_read_time_local | end_read_time_local | start_read | end_read | consumption | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1111 | 9/10/2024 0:00 | 9/10/2024 1:00 | 79118.91 | 79118.93 | 0.02 |  |
| 1111 | 9/10/2024 1:00 | 9/10/2024 2:00 |  |  | null | Missing Data |
| 1111 | 9/10/2024 2:00 | 9/10/2024 3:00 |  |  | null | Missing Data |
| 1111 | 9/10/2024 3:00 | 9/10/2024 4:00 | 79122.47 | 79123.99 | 1.52 |  |
| 2222 | 9/10/2024 0:00 | 9/10/2024 1:00 | 1937135 | 1937174 | 39 |  |
| 2222 | 9/10/2024 1:00 | 9/10/2024 2:00 | 1937174 | 1937191 | 17 |  |
| 2222 | 9/10/2024 2:00 | 9/10/2024 3:00 | 1937191 | 1937197 | 6 |  |
| 2222 | 9/10/2024 3:00 | 9/10/2024 4:00 | 1937197 | 1937202 | 5 |  |

I have looked and tried various solutions, but have not been able to successfully do this. My initial attempts were to use a combination of min/max of the `end_read_time_local` and `generate_series()` to create a sequence of timestamps that I would then right join to the `water_consumption` table, the result being the missing hours would have no consumption/reading values.

I was using this command to create the series and just make a list of 10 hours:

```sql
select (date_trunc('hour',current_timestamp) + ((a-1)||' hour')::interval)::timestamptz
from generate_series(1, 10, 1) as a
```

I'm struggling to join it, and I have yet to figure out how I will join these for each meter ID. In other words, I need the join to check to see if meter 1111 has a complete record as well as meter 2222.

I have a table `account` with distinct devices, where `device_id` matches `water_consumption.meter_id`.

Following d r's advice, I tried the following:

~~~pgsql
WITH 
   grid AS
    ( Select     a.device_id as meter_id, 
                 DATEADD('hrs', gs, DATE_TRUNC('day', wc.start_read_time_local)) as read_start, 
                 DATEADD('hrs', gs, DATE_TRUNC('day', wc.end_read_time_local)) as read_end,
                 Min(wc.start_read_time_local) as min_start_time, 
                 Max(wc.start_read_time_local) as max_end_time
      From       account a
      Inner Join water_consumption wc ON(wc.meter_id = a.device_id)
      Cross Join generate_series(0, 23) gs
      Group By   a.device_id, gs, DATE_TRUNC( 'day', wc.start_read_time_local)
    ) 
Select     g.meter_id, 
           Coalesce(wc.start_read_time_local, g.read_start) as start_read_time_local, 
           Coalesce(wc.end_read_time_local, g.read_end) as end_read_time_local, 
           wc.start_read, wc.end_read, wc.consumption, 
           Case When wc.start_read_time_local Is Null Then 'Missing Data' End as notes
From        grid g
Left Join   water_consumption wc ON(wc.meter_id = g.meter_id And 
                                    wc.start_read_time_local = g.read_start )
Where      read_start >= min_start_time And read_start <= max_end_time
Order By    g.meter_id, g.read_start

~~~

But I got this Redshift error: column "wc.end_read_time_local" must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used in an aggregate function

I tired to add it to the group by function, but didn't work.




## Baseline answer 

To fill  in the gaps in hours of a dates create a grid of all hours per date and meter_id - left join your readings data and use Coalesce() function to show every hour then define notes column as 'Missing Data' for hours without readings.
~~~sql
--    S a m p l e    D a t a : 
CREATE TABLE account AS
  Select 1111 as device_id Union All
  Select 2222;

CREATE TABLE water_consumption AS
  Select 1111 as meter_id, To_Timestamp('09/10/2024 00:00', 'mm/dd/yyyy hh24:mi') as start_read_time_local,  To_Timestamp('09/10/2024 01:00', 'mm/dd/yyyy hh24:mi') as end_read_time_local, 79118.91 as start_read	, 79118.93 as end_read, 0.02 as consumption Union All
  Select 1111,	To_Timestamp('09/10/2024 03:00', 'mm/dd/yyyy hh24:mi'), 	To_Timestamp('09/10/2024 04:00', 'mm/dd/yyyy hh24:mi'),	79122.47,	  79123.99,	1.52 Union All
  Select 2222,	To_Timestamp('09/10/2024 00:00', 'mm/dd/yyyy hh24:mi'), 	To_Timestamp('09/10/2024 01:00', 'mm/dd/yyyy hh24:mi'),	 1937135,	   1937174,	39 Union All

  Select 2222,	To_Timestamp('09/10/2024 02:00', 'mm/dd/yyyy hh24:mi'), 	To_Timestamp('09/10/2024 03:00', 'mm/dd/yyyy hh24:mi'),	 1937191,	   1937197,	6 Union All
  Select 2222,	To_Timestamp('09/10/2024 03:00', 'mm/dd/yyyy hh24:mi'), 	To_Timestamp('09/10/2024 04:00', 'mm/dd/yyyy hh24:mi'),	 1937197,	   1937202,	5;
~~~
... create a cte grid that will have a row for every hour for every date of reading and for every meter_id ...
~~~sql
WITH 
   grid AS
    ( Select     a.device_id as meter_id, 
                 DATE_TRUNC('day', wc.start_read_time_local) + interval '1 minute' * (gs * 60) as read_start,
                 DATE_TRUNC('day', wc.start_read_time_local) + interval '1 minute' * ((gs + 1) * 60) as read_end,
                 Min(wc.start_read_time_local) as min_start_time, 
                 Max(wc.start_read_time_local) as max_end_time
      From       account a
      Inner Join water_consumption wc ON(wc.meter_id = a.device_id)
      Cross Join generate_series(0, 23) gs
      Group By   a.device_id, gs, DATE_TRUNC( 'day', wc.start_read_time_local)
    ) 
~~~
... if you want the result as presented in your question - filter the data with WHERE clause as below. Without WHERE clause you will get all hours of a date per meter_id (see it in the fiddle - link is below)
~~~sql
--      M a i n    S Q L :

See the [fiddle here.][1]

**NOTE**    
This is tested with postgres but it should work on redshift with one adjustment in grid cte - adding hours to a date uses different syntax. 
~~~sql
-- read the redshift docs to deal with it - but it should be like this
DATEADD('hrs', gs, DATE_TRUNC('day', wc.start_read_time_local)) as read_start, 
DATEADD('hrs', gs, DATE_TRUNC('day', wc.end_read_time_local)) as read_end
--  instead of Postgres syntax used in cte grid definition code for columns read_start and read_end

## ChatGPT 4o

You're on the right track, but Redshift requires **all non-aggregated columns** to be explicitly included in the `GROUP BY` clause. Below is the **corrected and optimized query** to fill in missing hourly data per `meter_id`, marking missing rows with `"Missing Data"`.

---

### **Corrected Query for Amazon Redshift**
This query ensures:
1. **Generates an hourly series** for each `meter_id` based on the min/max `start_read_time_local` values.
2. **Joins generated timestamps** to actual readings, filling missing hours.
3. **Adds a "Missing Data" flag** for hours without actual readings.

```sql
WITH 
   time_grid AS (
      SELECT 
          a.device_id AS meter_id, 
          DATEADD(hour, gs, DATE_TRUNC('day', wc.min_start_time)) AS start_read_time_local
      FROM account a
      INNER JOIN (
          -- Get min and max time for each meter_id
          SELECT 
              meter_id, 
              MIN(start_read_time_local) AS min_start_time, 
              MAX(start_read_time_local) AS max_start_time
          FROM water_consumption
          GROUP BY meter_id
      ) wc ON wc.meter_id = a.device_id
      CROSS JOIN generate_series(0, 23) AS gs  -- Generate 24-hour grid per meter
   )
   
SELECT 
    g.meter_id, 
    g.start_read_time_local, 
    DATEADD(hour, 1, g.start_read_time_local) AS end_read_time_local,
    wc.start_read, 
    wc.end_read, 
    wc.consumption,
    CASE 
        WHEN wc.meter_id IS NULL THEN 'Missing Data' 
        ELSE NULL 
    END AS notes
FROM time_grid g
LEFT JOIN water_consumption wc 
    ON wc.meter_id = g.meter_id 
    AND wc.start_read_time_local = g.start_read_time_local
ORDER BY g.meter_id, g.start_read_time_local;
```

---

### **Explanation**
1. **`time_grid` CTE:** 
   - Generates **hourly timestamps** from `MIN(start_read_time_local)` to `MAX(start_read_time_local)`.
   - Ensures that even missing time slots are included.
   - Uses `generate_series(0, 23)` to create a **24-hour range** for each meter.
  
2. **`LEFT JOIN water_consumption wc`**
   - Matches actual readings with the generated time grid.
   - If no match, `wc.meter_id` is `NULL`, meaning the data is missing.

3. **The `CASE` statement**
   - If `wc.meter_id` is `NULL`, it marks the row as `"Missing Data"`.

---

### **Example Output**
| meter_id | start_read_time_local | end_read_time_local | start_read | end_read | consumption | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1111 | 2024-09-10 00:00:00 | 2024-09-10 01:00:00 | 79118.91 | 79118.93 | 0.02 |  |
| 1111 | 2024-09-10 01:00:00 | 2024-09-10 02:00:00 | NULL | NULL | NULL | Missing Data |
| 1111 | 2024-09-10 02:00:00 | 2024-09-10 03:00:00 | NULL | NULL | NULL | Missing Data |
| 1111 | 2024-09-10 03:00:00 | 2024-09-10 04:00:00 | 79122.47 | 79123.99 | 1.52 |  |
| 2222 | 2024-09-10 00:00:00 | 2024-09-10 01:00:00 | 1937135 | 1937174 | 39 |  |
| 2222 | 2024-09-10 01:00:00 | 2024-09-10 02:00:00 | 1937174 | 1937191 | 17 |  |
| 2222 | 2024-09-10 02:00:00 | 2024-09-10 03:00:00 | 1937191 | 1937197 | 6 |  |
| 2222 | 2024-09-10 03:00:00 | 2024-09-10 04:00:00 | 1937197 | 1937202 | 5 |  |

You're on the right track! The core issue you're facing is how to generate the complete hourly time series for each `meter_id` and then join it with your existing data, identifying the gaps. Let's break down the solution, addressing the Redshift error and refining the query.

**1. Generating the Hourly Time Series**

* **`generate_series()`:** As you correctly identified, `generate_series()` is crucial. We'll use it to create a sequence of timestamps for each hour within the relevant range.
* **Per `meter_id`:** We need to generate this series for each `meter_id` separately.
* **Range:** The range should be from the minimum to the maximum `start_read_time_local` for each `meter_id`.
* **Account table usage:** The account table is correctly used to assure that all device_id's are included, even if they have no current water_consumption data.

**2. Joining and Identifying Gaps**

* **`LEFT JOIN`:** We'll use a `LEFT JOIN` to combine the generated time series with your `water_consumption` data. This allows us to keep all the generated timestamps, even if there's no matching record in `water_consumption`.
* **`COALESCE`:** `COALESCE` will be used to fill in the missing `start_read_time_local` and `end_read_time_local` values with the generated timestamps.
* **`CASE` statement:** The `CASE` statement will be used to mark the missing rows with "Missing Data".

**3. Addressing the Redshift Error**

* **Aggregation:** The Redshift error "column "wc.end_read_time_local" must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used in an aggregate function" occurs because you're using `wc.end_read_time_local` in the `grid` CTE without grouping by it or using an aggregate function.
* **Resolution:** Because the end_read_time_local is always exactly one hour after the start_read_time_local, we can simply add one hour to the start_read_time_local inside of the grid CTE, and remove the end_read_time_local from it.

**Refined SQL Query (PostgreSQL/Redshift Compatible)**

```sql
WITH 
    grid AS (
        SELECT 
            a.device_id AS meter_id,
            DATE_TRUNC('hour', MIN(wc.start_read_time_local)) + (INTERVAL '1 hour' * gs) AS read_start,
            MIN(wc.start_read_time_local) AS min_start_time,
            MAX(wc.start_read_time_local) AS max_end_time
        FROM 
            account a
        LEFT JOIN 
            water_consumption wc ON wc.meter_id = a.device_id
        CROSS JOIN 
            generate_series(0, 23) gs
        GROUP BY 
            a.device_id, gs
    )
SELECT 
    g.meter_id,
    COALESCE(wc.start_read_time_local, g.read_start) AS start_read_time_local,
    COALESCE(wc.start_read_time_local + INTERVAL '1 hour', g.read_start + INTERVAL '1 hour') AS end_read_time_local,
    wc.start_read,
    wc.end_read,
    wc.consumption,
    CASE WHEN wc.start_read_time_local IS NULL THEN 'Missing Data' END AS notes
FROM 
    grid g
LEFT JOIN 
    water_consumption wc ON wc.meter_id = g.meter_id AND wc.start_read_time_local = g.read_start
WHERE 
    g.read_start >= g.min_start_time AND g.read_start <= g.max_end_time
ORDER BY 
    g.meter_id, g.read_start;
```

**Explanation of Changes**

1.  **`grid` CTE:**
    * The `end_read_time_local` column was removed.
    * The `DATE_TRUNC('hour', MIN(wc.start_read_time_local))` is used to get the start of the first hour that is present in the table.
    * The `LEFT JOIN` is used to get all device_id's from the account table.
2.  **Main `SELECT`:**
    * `COALESCE(wc.start_read_time_local + INTERVAL '1 hour', g.read_start + INTERVAL '1 hour')` is used to create the end_read_time_local column.
    * The `WHERE` clause assures that the generated times are between the min and max times.

**Important Notes**

* This query assumes that the maximum time range that needs to be generated is 24 hours. If a greater range is needed, the `generate_series(0,23)` part of the query will need to be changed.
* Test this query thoroughly on a test dataset to ensure it produces the desired results.
* Adjust the time range in `generate_series()` as needed.
* If you have a large number of `meter_id`s, consider adding indexes to improve query performance.
* The `INTERVAL` syntax is compatible with both PostgreSQL and Redshift.


## Q

Maximum character count is 1000 characters.

## DeepSeek R1

Here's a solution using PostgreSQL-compatible syntax that should work in Redshift. The key is to generate a complete time grid for each meter and left join the actual data:

```sql
WITH meter_dates AS (
    SELECT 
        meter_id,
        DATE_TRUNC('day', start_read_time_local) AS day_start,
        MAX(DATE_TRUNC('day', end_read_time_local)) AS max_day
    FROM water_consumption
    GROUP BY 1, 2
),
time_grid AS (
    SELECT
        meter_id,
        day_start + (n || ' hours')::INTERVAL AS start_read_time_local,
        day_start + ((n + 1) || ' hours')::INTERVAL AS end_read_time_local
    FROM meter_dates
    CROSS JOIN generate_series(0, 23) AS n
    WHERE day_start <= max_day
)
SELECT
    g.meter_id,
    g.start_read_time_local,
    g.end_read_time_local,
    wc.start_read,
    wc.end_read,
    wc.consumption,
    CASE WHEN wc.meter_id IS NULL THEN 'Missing Data' END AS notes
FROM time_grid g
LEFT JOIN water_consumption wc
    ON g.meter_id = wc.meter_id
    AND g.start_read_time_local = wc.start_read_time_local
ORDER BY g.meter_id, g.start_read_time_local;
```

**Key changes from your original approach:**
1. Separated grid generation into two CTEs
2. Avoided joining water_consumption table in the grid generation
3. Used explicit date arithmetic for hour intervals
4. Simplified the final LEFT JOIN condition

**How it works:**
1. `meter_dates` CTE: Gets date ranges for each meter
2. `time_grid` CTE: Generates all possible hourly slots for each meter's date range
3. Final query: Left joins actual data to complete time grid

**Redshift-specific considerations:**
- Use `::INTERVAL` for time arithmetic
- `generate_series` works in Redshift but must be in FROM clause
- Date truncation helps handle multi-day ranges efficiently

**To handle larger date ranges:**
```sql
-- Replace meter_dates CTE with:
meter_dates AS (
    SELECT 
        meter_id,
        MIN(DATE_TRUNC('day', start_read_time_local)) AS min_day,
        MAX(DATE_TRUNC('day', end_read_time_local)) AS max_day
    FROM water_consumption
    GROUP BY 1
),
```

This will generate hourly slots for the full date range of each meter rather than daily chunks.

## ChatGPT o1

Below is one general pattern for “filling in” missing hourly rows in Redshift/Postgres. The idea is:

1. Identify each meter’s overall time range (earliest to latest hour) in your water_consumption table.
2. For each meter, generate all hourly “slots” in that range (using a numbers table or generate_series).
3. Left-join your actual consumption records onto those slots. Rows with no matching record become the “Missing Data” rows.

Below is an illustrative query using Redshift-friendly syntax that should produce the result you want. Adjust table/column names as needed:

---

## Step 1: Compute Earliest/Latest Hours per Meter

```sql
-- "extremes" finds each meter's earliest and latest hour boundaries
WITH extremes AS (
  SELECT
    meter_id,
    -- Truncate to the hour boundary
    DATE_TRUNC('hour', MIN(start_read_time_local)) AS earliest_hour,
    DATE_TRUNC('hour', MAX(end_read_time_local))   AS latest_hour
  FROM water_consumption
  GROUP BY meter_id
),
```

---

## Step 2: Generate All Hourly Slots

Redshift doesn’t support a timestamp-based generate_series directly, but you can fake it by:

1. Creating a small “numbers” series on the fly, for example by taking row_number() over a sufficiently large table (or using a trick like `STV_Slice` if you know the approximate maximum hour span).
2. Use `DATEADD(hour, n, earliest_hour)` to step forward n hours from the earliest hour up to the latest hour.

In a typical approach, we generate a “sequence” subquery and join it to `extremes`:

```sql
-- "all_hours" enumerates every hour from earliest_hour to latest_hour for each meter
all_hours AS (
  SELECT
    e.meter_id,
    DATEADD(hour, seq.seqnum, e.earliest_hour) AS hour_start
  FROM extremes e
  -- This subselect creates a simple row-number (0..9999, etc.) to simulate generate_series
  JOIN (
    SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY TRUE) - 1 AS seqnum
    FROM svv_table_info  -- or any sufficiently large system table
    LIMIT 10000          -- adjust so it's large enough to cover the max hour range
  ) seq
    ON DATEADD(hour, seq.seqnum, e.earliest_hour) <= e.latest_hour
)
```

**Explanation**:  
- `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY TRUE) - 1` creates a 0-based sequence.  
- We only keep the rows where `earliest_hour + seqnum hours <= latest_hour`.  
- That results in every hour from earliest_hour up to latest_hour for each meter.

---

## Step 3: Left-Join to Actual Consumption Records

Now that we have every “hour_start” for every meter, we can left-join to water_consumption. Since your data lines up exactly on the hour, you can match on `(meter_id, start_read_time_local = hour_start)`. For each hour with no record, you get nulls, which you label “Missing Data.”

```sql
SELECT
  ah.meter_id,
  COALESCE(wc.start_read_time_local, ah.hour_start)          AS start_read_time_local,
  -- The end_read_time_local is typically hour_start + 1 hour,
  -- but if it’s in your table, we can either coalesce or just do hour_start + 1 hour:
  COALESCE(wc.end_read_time_local, DATEADD('hour', 1, ah.hour_start)) AS end_read_time_local,

  wc.start_read,
  wc.end_read,
  wc.consumption,
  CASE WHEN wc.meter_id IS NULL THEN 'Missing Data' END AS notes

FROM all_hours ah
LEFT JOIN water_consumption wc
  ON  wc.meter_id = ah.meter_id
  AND DATE_TRUNC('hour', wc.start_read_time_local) = ah.hour_start
-- or exactly equals if your data is always on the hour:
-- AND wc.start_read_time_local = ah.hour_start

ORDER BY ah.meter_id, ah.hour_start;
```

---

### Putting It All Together

Below is a full combined query example (Redshift style). This assumes:

- `water_consumption(meter_id, start_read_time_local, end_read_time_local, start_read, end_read, consumption)`
- Each record is already aligned to an exact hour boundary in `start_read_time_local`.
- You only need to fill hour-by-hour between the earliest and latest times for that meter.

```sql
WITH extremes AS (
  SELECT
    meter_id,
    DATE_TRUNC('hour', MIN(start_read_time_local)) AS earliest_hour,
    DATE_TRUNC('hour', MAX(end_read_time_local))   AS latest_hour
  FROM water_consumption
  GROUP BY meter_id
),
all_hours AS (
  SELECT
    e.meter_id,
    DATEADD(hour, seq.seqnum, e.earliest_hour) AS hour_start
  FROM extremes e
  JOIN (
    SELECT
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY TRUE) - 1 AS seqnum
    FROM svv_table_info
    LIMIT 10000
  ) seq
    ON DATEADD(hour, seq.seqnum, e.earliest_hour) <= e.latest_hour
)
SELECT
  ah.meter_id,
  COALESCE(wc.start_read_time_local, ah.hour_start) AS start_read_time_local,
  COALESCE(wc.end_read_time_local, DATEADD('hour', 1, ah.hour_start)) AS end_read_time_local,
  wc.start_read,
  wc.end_read,
  wc.consumption,
  CASE WHEN wc.meter_id IS NULL THEN 'Missing Data' END AS notes
FROM all_hours ah
LEFT JOIN water_consumption wc
  ON wc.meter_id = ah.meter_id
  AND DATE_TRUNC('hour', wc.start_read_time_local) = ah.hour_start
ORDER BY ah.meter_id, ah.hour_start;
```

### A Few Notes

1. **Hourly Alignment**: The above approach assumes each row in `water_consumption` starts exactly on the hour (e.g., 9/10/2024 3:00). If your times can be offset, you might need a different join condition or approximate matching.  
2. **One-Hour “End”**: This example forcibly sets `COALESCE(..., dateadd('hour',1, ah.hour_start))` for `end_read_time_local`. Adjust if your real data does something else for missing rows.  
3. **Performance**: Generating a large number of rows can be expensive if you have many meters with big time ranges. You may want to limit the time window or store a permanent “numbers” table.  
4. **Superset**: Because Superset simply runs queries behind the scenes, you can paste the final combined SQL in Superset’s SQL Lab. The result set should have your “Missing Data” rows.  

With this pattern, you’ll see a complete row for every hour for every meter, filling in “Missing Data” wherever the original table had no reading.

Note: The five LLMs have been anonymized in the analysis below, as follows: ChatGPT-4o is Chatbot #1, Gemini 2.0 Flash is Chatbot #2, Q is Chatbot #3, DeepSeek R1 is Chatbot #4 and ChatGPT-o1 is Chatbot #5

Below is a comparative analysis of the five chatbot responses, referencing the **baseline answer** from Stack Overflow:

---

## Baseline Answer (Summary)

The user wants to **fill missing hourly rows** in a time series of consumption readings. The baseline solution is:

1. Generate an **hourly “grid”** (or “time grid”) for each meter from the earliest to latest reading times.  
2. **Left join** that grid to the real consumption data.  
3. **Coalesce** columns so that if the real row is missing for a particular hour, you get a row with null consumption and a “Missing Data” note.

In a typical example, the baseline includes a CTE that:

1. Retrieves `MIN` and `MAX` timestamps for each meter.  
2. Cross-joins with `generate_series(0, 23)` (for 24 hours or however many hours needed).  
3. Then left-joins the actual data, labeling missing rows as “Missing Data.”
