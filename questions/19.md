## [Question 19 (Dez 17, 2023)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77674389/amazon-bedrock-agent-access-denied-when-calling-bedrock-check-your-request-pe)

Amazon Bedrock Agent - Access denied when calling Bedrock. Check your request permissions and retry the request

I'm building an agent using AWS Bedrock, I have created a knowledge base and allowed AWS bedrock to configure access policies. 

When I try to invoke the Agent I get the following error: `Access denied when calling Bedrock. Check your request permissions and retry the request.`

I have tried setting IAM permissions to `AdministratorAccess` for the service role.


Further, I have added these inline policies in addition to the AWS defined policies + Administrator access

## Baseline answer 

It was an issue with access to the ‘Anthropic’ models. Please make sure that you submit a use case and get access to the models. You will be granted access usually within a few hours.

### **Fixing "Access denied when calling Bedrock" Error in AWS Bedrock Agent**

Your **AWS Bedrock Agent** is failing due to **IAM permission issues**, even though you have given **AdministratorAccess** and additional inline policies.

---

## **Possible Causes & Fixes**
### **1. Verify IAM Role Assigned to the Bedrock Agent**
AWS Bedrock Agents **use a specific execution role**. Ensure that the correct **IAM role is assigned** to the agent.

#### **Fix: Check the Role Assigned to Your Agent**
1. **Go to AWS Console → Bedrock → Agents**
2. Click on your **Agent**.
3. Scroll to **Execution Role ARN**.
4. Copy the IAM role ARN and verify that it includes the correct permissions.

✅ **If the role is missing permissions, attach the correct policies**.

---

### **2. Update IAM Role with Correct Permissions**
Even though you've assigned `AdministratorAccess`, AWS **sometimes restricts Bedrock agent roles from assuming certain permissions**.

#### **Fix: Attach the Required Policies**
Modify your IAM role and explicitly **add Bedrock permissions**.

### **Minimal Required Policy for Bedrock Agents**
Replace your current policy with this:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "bedrock:InvokeModel",
                "bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream",
                "bedrock:Retrieve",
                "bedrock:RetrieveAndGenerate",
                "bedrock:QueryKnowledgeBase",
                "bedrock:ListFoundationModels",
                "bedrock:GetFoundationModel",
                "bedrock:ListCustomModels"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:PassRole"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "iam:PassedToService": "bedrock.amazonaws.com"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

✅ **Why?**
- **Fixes missing `bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream`**.
- **Ensures access to Bedrock foundation models**.
- **Allows role to interact with S3 if using knowledge bases**.
- **Enables passing IAM roles to Bedrock Agents**.

---

### **3. Ensure Correct Region for Bedrock Permissions**
AWS Bedrock **is only available in certain regions**. If you're using **IAM policies with hardcoded ARNs**, ensure the region **matches your deployment**.

#### **Fix: Check Region in Your Policy**
Your current policy has:
```json
"Resource": [
    "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-v2",
    "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-instant-v1"
]
```

If your Bedrock Agent is in a different region (e.g., **`us-west-2`**), update these ARNs accordingly or use:
```json
"Resource": "*"
```

✅ **Why?**  
- Hardcoded region ARNs can cause **permission mismatches**.
- **Use `"Resource": "*"` to allow flexibility**.

---

### **4. Validate Bedrock Agent Execution Role**
AWS Bedrock requires **IAM roles with correct trust relationships**.

#### **Fix: Ensure the Trust Policy Allows Bedrock to Assume the Role**
Check your **IAM Trust Policy**:
1. **Go to AWS IAM Console → Roles**.
2. Find the **role assigned to your Bedrock Agent**.
3. Click **"Trust relationships"** and ensure it contains:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "bedrock.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```

✅ **Why?**
- Without this, **Bedrock cannot assume the role**.

---

### **5. Verify API Call Details in CloudTrail**
If issues persist, check AWS **CloudTrail** for permission errors.

#### **Fix: Check CloudTrail Logs**
1. **Go to AWS Console → CloudTrail**.
2. **Look for `AccessDenied` events in `bedrock:InvokeModel`**.
3. Identify which IAM role is being used and missing permissions.

✅ **Why?**
- CloudTrail **pinpoints exact permission failures**.

---

## **Final Checklist**
| Issue | Solution |
|------|---------|
| **Incorrect IAM Role Assigned to Agent** | Check **execution role in AWS Bedrock Console** |
| **Missing `InvokeModelWithResponseStream` Permission** | Add **`bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream`** to IAM policy |
| **IAM Role Lacks Trust Policy** | Ensure **Bedrock (`bedrock.amazonaws.com`) can assume the role** |
| **Hardcoded Region Mismatch** | Use **`"Resource": "*"`** or match Bedrock region |
| **Need Debugging Information** | Check **CloudTrail logs for permission errors** |

---

### **Final Steps to Fix the Issue**
1. **Check the IAM role assigned to your Bedrock Agent**.
2. **Attach the updated IAM policy with correct Bedrock permissions**.
3. **Ensure the IAM trust policy allows Bedrock to assume the role**.
4. **Verify API calls in CloudTrail for permission failures**.
5. **Try invoking the Bedrock Agent again**.

🚀 After applying these fixes, your Bedrock Agent should work without **Access Denied** errors. Let me know if you need further debugging! ✅

## Gemini

The user is encountering an "Access denied" error when invoking an Amazon Bedrock Agent, despite granting extensive IAM permissions, including `AdministratorAccess` and specific inline policies. The error suggests that the Agent's service role lacks the necessary permissions to call Bedrock services or access the knowledge base.

Here's a breakdown of the problem and potential solutions:

**Understanding the Problem:**

* **Bedrock Agent Service Role:**
    * Agents in Amazon Bedrock use a service role to interact with other AWS services, including Bedrock models and knowledge bases.
    * The error indicates that this role is missing the required permissions.
* **Overly Broad Permissions:**
    * While `AdministratorAccess` and broad wildcard permissions (`bedrock:*`, `s3:*`, `Resource: "*"`) might seem to solve the issue, they can sometimes mask the underlying problem or introduce security risks.
    * It is always best to grant only the needed permissions.
* **Specific Resource ARNs:**
    * The user has attempted to add specific ARNs for foundation models and the knowledge base, which is a good step. However, there might be other missing permissions.
* **Knowledge Base Permissions:**
    * Even if the service role has Bedrock permissions, it might lack permissions to access the specific knowledge base or the underlying data source (e.g., S3 bucket).
* **Agent Permissions:**
    * There are agent specific permissions that are needed.

**Solutions:**

1.  **Verify the Agent's Service Role:**

    * Confirm the exact IAM role that the Bedrock Agent is using.
    * In the Bedrock console, navigate to your Agent and check its configuration for the service role.
    * Ensure that the IAM policies are attached to the correct role.

2.  **Refine IAM Policies:**

    * Instead of relying on `AdministratorAccess`, use more specific IAM policies.
    * **Agent Permissions:**
        * Ensure that the service role has the following permissions:
            * `bedrock-agent-runtime:InvokeAgent`
            * `bedrock-agent-runtime:RetrieveAndGenerate`
            * `bedrock-agent-runtime:Retrieve`
            * `bedrock:QueryKnowledgeBase`
            * `bedrock:InvokeModel`
        * Also, ensure the role has permissions for any tools that the agent uses.
    * **Knowledge Base Permissions:**
        * Verify that the service role has permissions to access the knowledge base:
            * `bedrock:QueryKnowledgeBase`
            * `bedrock:Retrieve`
            * `bedrock:RetrieveAndGenerate`
        * If the knowledge base uses an S3 bucket as its data source, ensure the service role has the necessary S3 read permissions.
            * `s3:GetObject`
            * `s3:ListBucket`
        * Replace `:knowledge-base-id` in your resource arn with the actual knowledge base id.
    * **Foundation Model Permissions:**
        * Ensure that the service role has `bedrock:InvokeModel` permission for the specific foundation models used by the Agent.
        * It is best practice to only give invoke model permissions for the specific models that the agent will use.
    * **Remove Wildcard Permissions:**
        * Remove the overly broad wildcard permissions (`bedrock:*`, `s3:*`, `Resource: "*"`) from your inline policies.
        * This will allow for better security, and allow you to pinpoint the exact missing permission.

3.  **Check Knowledge Base Configuration:**

    * Verify that the knowledge base is correctly configured and accessible.
    * Ensure that the data source (e.g., S3 bucket) is accessible and contains the necessary data.
    * Ensure that the knowledge base has been correctly synced.

4.  **Review CloudTrail Logs:**

    * Use AWS CloudTrail to examine the API calls made by the Agent.
    * CloudTrail logs can provide detailed information about access denied errors, including the specific actions and resources involved.
    * This will allow you to see the exact permission that is missing.

5.  **Test with Minimal Permissions:**

    * Create a new IAM role with minimal permissions and gradually add permissions until the Agent works.
    * This can help you identify the precise permissions required.

6.  **Region:**

    * Ensure that all resources are in the same region.

**Example IAM Policy (Refined):**

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "bedrock-agent-runtime:InvokeAgent",
                "bedrock-agent-runtime:RetrieveAndGenerate",
                "bedrock-agent-runtime:Retrieve",
                "bedrock:QueryKnowledgeBase",
                "bedrock:InvokeModel"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1:account-id:agent/*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "bedrock:QueryKnowledgeBase",
                "bedrock:Retrieve",
                "bedrock:RetrieveAndGenerate"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1:account-id:knowledge-base/knowledge-base-id"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "bedrock:InvokeModel",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-v2",
                "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-instant-v1"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-knowledge-base-bucket",
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-knowledge-base-bucket/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

**Replace placeholders:**

* `account-id` with your AWS account ID.
* `knowledge-base-id` with your knowledge base ID.
* `your-knowledge-base-bucket` with your S3 bucket name.

By following these steps, the user can identify and resolve the permission issue.

To resolve the **"Access denied when calling Bedrock"** error for your Bedrock Agent, follow these steps:

---

### **1. Fix the Service Role Permissions**
#### Core Bedrock Permissions:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "BedrockAgentKnowledgeBaseAccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "bedrock:InvokeModel",
                "bedrock:Retrieve",
                "bedrock:RetrieveAndGenerate",
                "bedrock:QueryKnowledgeBase"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                // Allow specific models
                "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-v2",
                "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-instant-v1",
                // Allow knowledge base access (replace placeholders)
                "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1:YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:knowledge-base/YOUR_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "S3BucketAccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_S3_BUCKET/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_S3_BUCKET"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "KMSDecrypt",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "kms:Decrypt",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:key/YOUR_KMS_KEY_ID"
        }
    ]
}
```

---

### **2. Add OpenSearch Serverless Permissions (If Used)**
If your knowledge base uses OpenSearch Serverless:
```json
{
    "Sid": "OpenSearchAccess",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "aoss:APIAccessAll"
    ],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:aoss:us-east-1:YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:collection/YOUR_OPENSEARCH_COLLECTION_ID"
}
```

---

### **3. Verify Trust Relationships**
Ensure your service role trusts the Bedrock service:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "bedrock.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### **4. Enable Bedrock Model Access**
1. Go to **AWS Bedrock Console → Model Access**  
2. Request access to the Claude models (if not already granted).

---

### **5. Validate Knowledge Base Resource Policy**
In the knowledge base settings:
1. Ensure the resource policy allows your agent’s role:
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:role/YOUR_BEDROCK_AGENT_ROLE"
         },
         "Action": [
           "bedrock:Retrieve",
           "bedrock:QueryKnowledgeBase"
         ],
         "Resource": "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1:YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:knowledge-base/YOUR_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

---

### **6. Troubleshooting Steps**
1. **Test Permissions Locally**:
   ```bash
   aws bedrock retrieve \
     --knowledge-base-id YOUR_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID \
     --retrievalQuery '{"text":"Test query"}' \
     --region us-east-1
   ```
2. **Check CloudTrail Logs** for detailed access denial reasons.

---

### **Key Fixes Summary**
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Missing Bedrock model permissions | Explicitly allow `bedrock:InvokeModel` on model ARNs |
| Knowledge base ARN typo | Use exact ARN with account ID and knowledge base ID |
| S3 bucket access | Add `s3:GetObject` and `s3:ListBucket` |
| KMS encryption | Grant `kms:Decrypt` on the S3 bucket’s KMS key |
| Trust relationship | Allow `bedrock.amazonaws.com` to assume the role |

By addressing these areas, the "Access denied" error should resolve. Let me know if you need further clarification! 🚀

## ChatGPT o1

Below are some likely reasons why Bedrock returns an “Access denied” error even though you granted `AdministratorAccess` plus additional inline policies, along with steps to fix it. The core issue is usually that an Agent call requires additional Bedrock permissions beyond `InvokeModel`, or that the agent is running under a role / principal that does not have the correct policy attached.

---

## 1. Make Sure You Include the Agent-Specific Actions in Your Policy

When you use **Bedrock Agents**, the service typically calls “agent” actions behind the scenes (e.g., `bedrock:InvokeAgent`, `bedrock:StartAgentConversation`, etc.). Simply having `bedrock:InvokeModel` or `bedrock:RetrieveAndGenerate` for the foundation models isn’t enough.

For example, you might need a policy snippet like:

```json
{
  "Sid": "BedrockAgentActions",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "bedrock:InvokeAgent",
    "bedrock:StartAgentConversation",
    "bedrock:UpdateAgent",
    "bedrock:GetAgent",
    "bedrock:ListAgents",
    "bedrock:CreateAgent",
    "bedrock:DeleteAgent"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

(Adjust “Resource” to a more specific ARN if you prefer, but often you must specify `*` if you’re not sure of the agent’s ARN.)

If you have a knowledge base, you likely also need (depending on how you created it):

```json
{
  "Sid": "BedrockKnowledgeBaseActions",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "bedrock:CreateKnowledgeBase",
    "bedrock:UpdateKnowledgeBase",
    "bedrock:DeleteKnowledgeBase",
    "bedrock:GetKnowledgeBase",
    "bedrock:ListKnowledgeBases",
    "bedrock:QueryKnowledgeBase",
    "bedrock:Retrieve",
    "bedrock:RetrieveAndGenerate",
    "bedrock:UploadDocument",
    "bedrock:UpdateDocument",
    "bedrock:DeleteDocument",
    "bedrock:GetDocument",
    "bedrock:ListDocuments"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

(Again, you can limit these to the actual knowledge base ARN if you know it.)

---

## 2. Confirm the Role Actually Used by Your Agent

Even if you have a service role with “AdministratorAccess,” the agent or knowledge base might be using a different role behind the scenes. For instance, if you let Bedrock “configure access policies automatically,” it might have created or attached a separate role with limited permissions.

- **Check** the “Agent details” in the Bedrock console and see which IAM role is associated.  
- Make sure that role also has the correct policy.  
- Alternatively, if you’re calling the agent from your code, ensure your code’s principal (IAM user / role) includes “bedrock:InvokeAgent” permission.

---

## 3. Watch Out for Region or Account Mismatches

Sometimes you have the right policy but for a different region or account. For example, if your agent is in `us-east-1`, your policy or ARNs must reference `us-east-1`, not another region.

Double-check:

- The region in the ARN for your knowledge base or foundation models: `arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-v2`  
- The account ID in `arn:aws:bedrock:*:123456789012:knowledge-base/*` or the appropriate region’s portion.  

---

## 4. Use Wildcard Resource if Unsure

Because Bedrock is still new, many users find it simplest to use `"Resource": "*"` while testing. For instance:

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "bedrock:*"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

(This is effectively the same as giving full Bedrock access, which `AdministratorAccess` should do, but if your role or inline policy is interfering, specifying it explicitly can help debug.)

Once it works, you can lock it down to the specific foundation model or knowledge base ARN.

---

## 5. Validate with the AWS Policy Simulator or Check CloudTrail

If it still fails, look at [CloudTrail logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events-console.html) or the [IAM Policy Simulator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_testing-policies.html) to see exactly which action is being denied. The event name might show `InvokeAgent`, `StartAgentConversation`, or something else that you didn’t explicitly allow.

---

### Summary

- **Add** “agent” actions (like `bedrock:InvokeAgent`, `bedrock:StartAgentConversation`) to the role’s policy.  
- **Check** the actual IAM role your Bedrock Agent is using – if it’s different from your “Administrator” user or role, it needs the same permissions.  
- **Confirm** region and account ID in the ARNs.  
- **Use** wildcard “Resource”: “*” for quick testing, then refine if needed.  

Once your role includes all required Bedrock actions (especially those for Agent usage) and is attached to the correct principal or agent, the “Access denied when calling Bedrock” error should disappear.

## Analysis 

Note: The five LLMs have been anonymized in the analysis below, as follows: ChatGPT-4o is Chatbot #1, Gemini 2.0 Flash is Chatbot #2, Q is Chatbot #3, DeepSeek R1 is Chatbot #4 and ChatGPT-o1 is Chatbot #5

Below is an evaluation of each chatbot response, measured against the **baseline Stack Overflow answer**:

---

## Baseline Answer (Summary)

The user is getting an “Access denied” error invoking an Amazon Bedrock Agent. The **baseline answer** says:

> You must have explicit permission to the Anthropic Claude models in your AWS account. Make sure you have been granted access. If not, you need to request access to those models from AWS. The error indicates you do not have permission to call that foundation model.

Hence, the baseline strongly emphasizes that the user must get “model access” from Amazon (particularly for the Anthropic model) – because it’s a restricted model that requires a manual approval process. Once you have that approval, the “Access denied” goes away.

- Focuses on the idea that the user’s role might be missing `bedrock:InvokeModel`, `bedrock:QueryKnowledgeBase`, or “foundation model” resource ARNs, etc. This is the typical approach: fix the IAM policy. 
- The baseline says the real cause is that you must get access to the models from AWS. #1 doesn’t mention the possibility that you simply do not have the model permission (like a restricted model). 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

### 2. Completeness
- Doesn’t mention that you might need AWS to grant you usage to the Anthropic models. That’s the main point from the baseline. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

### 3. Clarity
- The response is structured well, but missing the mention of requesting model access from AWS. 
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

### 4. Practicality
- Provides solutions for adding the right policy to your agent’s role. Good, but not referencing the baseline’s mention that you need explicit model access from AWS. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #1)**: **Partially Satisfactory**

## Chatbot Response #2

### 1. Accuracy
- Tells the user they might be missing bedrock or knowledge base permissions, or they must refine the policy. 
- The baseline specifically says "You need to get model access from AWS if it’s restricted." #2 does not mention that you must request that model usage from AWS. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

### 2. Completeness
- It does not mention the real possibility that the user hasn't been granted permission from AWS for Anthropic Claude. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

### 3. Clarity
- The structure is good. 
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

### 4. Practicality
- The steps to fix the policy are practical, but might not fix it if the user literally does not have Anthropic access from AWS. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #2)**: **Partially Satisfactory**

## Chatbot Response #3

### 1. Accuracy / 2. Completeness / 3. Clarity / 4. Practicality
- It's presumably truncated or missing. 
**Overall**: **Unsatisfactory**

## Chatbot Response #4

### Accuracy
- The response suggests adjusting the agent role trust policy, or region mismatch, or knowledge base policy. But does not mention the user may need to ask AWS for Anthropic model access. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

### Completeness
- The baseline specifically says the user must get permission from AWS if they haven’t completed the model access request. #4 doesn’t mention that. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

### Clarity
- The response is well structured. 
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

### Practicality
- The policy suggestions are helpful. But missing the key point from the baseline. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #4)**: **Partially Satisfactory**

## Chatbot Response #5

### Accuracy
- #5 focuses on the user’s role missing agent or model permissions, or the user not specifying the correct ARNs for the model or knowledge base. 
- The baseline’s main emphasis is that the user must request access from AWS to the Anthropic models. #5 does not mention that. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

### Completeness
- Omits the possibility that user simply hasn't been granted usage from Amazon for that specific foundation model. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

### Clarity
- The structure is good, enumerating all the possible policy changes. 
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

### Practicality
- Decent approach for adjusting policies, but the user might still get “AccessDenied” if they have not requested usage from AWS for that model. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #5)**: **Partially Satisfactory**

# Summary

**Baseline**: The user must specifically request from AWS the right to use “Anthropic Claude,” or they’ll get “AccessDenied” no matter how many perms they grant in IAM. All the chatbots only mention standard policy fixes, none mention the real fix from the baseline.

**Worst**: #3 is incomplete.  
**All** the others are partial, ignoring the main cause from the baseline. 

**Best** among them: #1 or #4 or #5 or #2 all provide thorough policy solutions, but none mention the baseline’s “request model usage from AWS.”
