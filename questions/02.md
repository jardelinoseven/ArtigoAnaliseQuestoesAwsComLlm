Wkhtmltopdf Not Working on Amazon Linux 2023

I installed wkhtmltox-0.12.6-1.amazonlinux2.x86_64.rpm on my EC2 instance(t3.xlarge). While using wkhtmltopdf in Node.js, I'm getting the following error:
Error generating PDF: Error: wkhtmltopdf: error while loading shared libraries: libpng15.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory wkhtmltopdf exited with code 127 at handleError (/var/www/html/Transectra/node_modules/wkhtmltopdf/index.js:161:16) at ChildProcess.<anonymous> (/var/www/html/Transectra/node_modules/wkhtmltopdf/index.js:133:7) at ChildProcess.emit (node:events:517:28) at ChildProcess._handle.onexit (node:internal/child_process:292:12)
I tried to install libpng15 but can't able to install it, but I only want this wkhtmltopdf library


## Baseline answer 

I tried to install with def

dnf install -y https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/packaging/releases/download/0.12.6.1-3/wkhtmltox-0.12.6.1-3.almalinux9.$(uname -m).rpm

now check version

wkhtmltopdf --version


## ChatGPT 4o

The error **"wkhtmltopdf: error while loading shared libraries: libpng15.so.15: cannot open shared object file"** suggests that **wkhtmltopdf is missing a required shared library (`libpng15.so.15`)**. Since you're running **Amazon Linux 2023**, which is based on Fedora and doesn't have `libpng15` in its default repositories, you'll need a workaround.

### **Possible Solutions:**

#### **1. Manually Install `libpng15` (Recommended)**
Amazon Linux 2023 doesn't include `libpng15` by default. However, you can manually install it by fetching an RPM from an older Amazon Linux 2 or CentOS 7 repository:

```sh
cd /tmp
curl -O http://vault.centos.org/centos/7/os/x86_64/Packages/libpng15-1.5.13-8.el7.x86_64.rpm
sudo yum localinstall libpng15-1.5.13-8.el7.x86_64.rpm -y
```

This should resolve the missing library issue.

---

#### **2. Use `ldd` to Verify Dependencies**
Run the following command to check which shared libraries are missing:

```sh
ldd /usr/local/bin/wkhtmltopdf
```

If it still reports missing dependencies (such as `libjpeg.so.62` or others), you may need to install additional libraries using:

```sh
sudo yum install -y libjpeg libXrender
```

---

#### **3. Use a Statically Linked Version of `wkhtmltopdf`**
Instead of using the RPM package, you can try the **static binary**, which includes all dependencies:

```sh
cd /usr/local/bin
wget https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/packaging/releases/download/0.12.6-1/wkhtmltox-0.12.6-1.alpine-linux-amd64.tar.xz
tar -xJf wkhtmltox-0.12.6-1.alpine-linux-amd64.tar.xz
mv wkhtmltox/bin/wkhtmltopdf /usr/local/bin/
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/wkhtmltopdf
```

This version should work without needing external libraries.

---

#### **4. Verify Binary Execution**
After installing the required dependencies, verify that `wkhtmltopdf` runs correctly:

```sh
wkhtmltopdf --version
```

If it still fails, try running with `ldd` again to confirm all dependencies are resolved.

---

### **Final Recommendation**
If you need **quick resolution**, the **static binary approach (Solution 3)** is the best option since it avoids dependency issues. If you prefer using the RPM package, manually installing `libpng15` from CentOS 7 (Solution 1) should work.

The error "wkhtmltopdf: error while loading shared libraries: libpng15.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory" means that `wkhtmltopdf` cannot find the required `libpng15.so.15` shared library on your Amazon Linux 2023 instance. 

Here are a few ways to solve this:

**1. Install libpng15**

* Although you mentioned you couldn't install `libpng15`, it's crucial to have this library for `wkhtmltopdf` to function correctly.
* **Enable EPEL repository**: The `libpng15` package might not be available in the default Amazon Linux 2023 repositories. Try enabling the EPEL repository, which often contains additional packages:
   ```bash
   sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel
   ```
* **Install libpng15**: Then, try installing `libpng15`:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install libpng15
   ```

**2. Use a Different wkhtmltopdf Version**

* **Compatibility**: The version of `wkhtmltopdf` you installed (wkhtmltox-0.12.6-1.amazonlinux2.x86_64.rpm) might not be fully compatible with Amazon Linux 2023.
* **Alternative Versions**: Try using the version built for AlmaLinux 9, which has been reported to work on Amazon Linux 2023:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/packaging/releases/download/0.12.6.1-2/wkhtmltox-0.12.6.1-2.almalinux9.x86_64.rpm
   ```

**3. Static Linking (If Possible)**

* **Static Build**: If you have the option to build `wkhtmltopdf` from source, consider statically linking the libraries. This will embed the required libraries within the `wkhtmltopdf` executable, eliminating the dependency on external shared libraries.
* **Note**: This might increase the size of the executable, but it can simplify deployment and avoid dependency issues.

**4. Troubleshooting**

* **Verify Installation**: After installing `libpng15` or a different `wkhtmltopdf` version, verify that the `libpng15.so.15` file exists in your system's library path (e.g., `/usr/lib64`).
* **Dynamic Linker**: If the library is present but you still get the error, check the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. It should include the directory where `libpng15.so.15` is located. You can add the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file:
   ```bash
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib64
   ```

If you're still facing issues after trying these solutions, provide more details about your environment and any error messages you encounter, and I'll do my best to assist further.

## Q

To help troubleshoot this issue with wkhtmltopdf on your Amazon Linux 2023 EC2 instance, I'd like to check the health of your EC2 resources. Can you please provide the following information:

1. The AWS region where your EC2 instance is running (e.g., us-east-1)
2. The instance ID of your t3.xlarge EC2 instance
3. The approximate time window when you encountered this error (please narrow it down to less than 30 minutes if possible)

If you're not sure about any of these details, just let me know, and I'll look at all the metrics in the AWS/EC2 namespace for the last 30 minutes in your current region.


## DeepSeek R1

Here are the recommended solutions to resolve the `libpng15.so.15` dependency error when using **wkhtmltopdf on Amazon Linux 2023**:

---

### **1. Install `libpng15` Manually**
Since Amazon Linux 2023 doesn’t include `libpng15` in its repositories, compile it from source:

```bash
# Install build tools
sudo dnf install -y gcc make wget

# Download libpng15 source
wget https://download.sourceforge.net/libpng/libpng-1.5.30.tar.gz
tar -xvf libpng-1.5.30.tar.gz
cd libpng-1.5.30

# Compile and install
./configure
make
sudo make install

# Update shared library cache
sudo ldconfig
```

---

### **2. Use a Static Build of wkhtmltopdf**
Download a **statically compiled wkhtmltopdf binary** that includes all dependencies (like `libpng15`):

```bash
# Download the static binary (example for 64-bit Linux)
wget https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/packaging/releases/download/0.12.6-1/wkhtmltox-0.12.6-1.centos8.x86_64.rpm

# Install the RPM
sudo rpm -Uvh wkhtmltox-0.12.6-1.centos8.x86_64.rpm

# Verify installation
wkhtmltopdf --version
```

---

### **3. Run wkhtmltopdf in a Docker Container**
Avoid dependency issues by running wkhtmltopdf in a Docker container with all required libraries:

```bash
# Create a Dockerfile
FROM amazonlinux:2023
RUN yum install -y wget tar gzip libX11 libXext libXrender xorg-x11-fonts-75dpi xorg-x11-fonts-Type1
RUN wget https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/packaging/releases/download/0.12.6-1/wkhtmltox-0.12.6-1.centos8.x86_64.rpm && \
    rpm -Uvh wkhtmltox-0.12.6-1.centos8.x86_64.rpm

# Build and run the container
docker build -t wkhtmltopdf .
docker run -v $(pwd):/app wkhtmltopdf wkhtmltopdf http://example.com /app/output.pdf
```

---

### **4. Use a Prebuilt libpng15.so.15 Library**
Manually place the missing library in `/usr/lib64/`:

```bash
# Download libpng15.so.15
wget http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/os/x86_64/Packages/libpng-1.5.13-8.el7.x86_64.rpm

# Extract the RPM
rpm2cpio libpng-1.5.13-8.el7.x86_64.rpm | cpio -idmv

# Copy the library
sudo cp usr/lib64/libpng15.so.15.13.0 /usr/lib64/
sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/libpng15.so.15.13.0 /usr/lib64/libpng15.so.15

# Update linker cache
sudo ldconfig
```

---

### **5. Switch to an Alternative PDF Library**
If wkhtmltopdf is too cumbersome, consider these Node.js alternatives:

#### **Puppeteer (Chrome Headless)**
```bash
npm install puppeteer
```

```javascript
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  await page.pdf({ path: 'output.pdf' });
  await browser.close();
})();
```

#### **PDFKit**
```bash
npm install pdfkit
```

---

### **6. Verify wkhtmltopdf Installation**
After resolving dependencies, confirm the installation works:
```bash
wkhtmltopdf --version
# Should output: wkhtmltopdf 0.12.6 (with patched qt)
```

---

### **Why This Happens**
- Amazon Linux 2023 uses newer libraries (e.g., `libpng16+`), while the `wkhtmltox-0.12.6` RPM for Amazon Linux 2 depends on `libpng15`.
- Static builds or Docker containers sidestep dependency conflicts.

---

### **Final Recommendation**
- **Best Option:** Use the **static binary** or **Docker** to avoid manual dependency management.
- **Alternative:** Migrate to Puppeteer for better long-term maintainability.

## ChatGPT-o1

Below are several approaches you can try to get wkhtmltopdf working on Amazon Linux 2023:

1. **Use a version of wkhtmltopdf compatible with Amazon Linux 2023**  
   - The rpm you installed is specifically built for Amazon Linux 2, which still depends on `libpng15`. Amazon Linux 2023 is newer and no longer provides `libpng15` by default.  
   - If possible, look for a wkhtmltopdf package (or static binary) officially built for Amazon Linux 2023. This will ensure the required libraries (like `libpng16`) match what’s available on your system.

2. **Install a static build of wkhtmltopdf**  
   - A statically linked wkhtmltopdf includes most dependencies built in, so you won’t be missing shared libraries such as `libpng15`.  
   - You can often download a “.tar.xz” or “.tar.gz” release with “static” in the name from the wkhtmltopdf GitHub releases page (or other mirrors). Extract it and place it in `/usr/local/bin/`, making sure it’s executable.  
   - This approach avoids installing an older or missing library altogether.

3. **Compile wkhtmltopdf from source**  
   - If no precompiled binaries are available for Amazon Linux 2023, you could compile wkhtmltopdf from source on your instance. This can be time-consuming but ensures you link against the libraries available on Amazon Linux 2023 (like `libpng16`).  
   - You would need the development tools and dependencies (e.g., Qt, libjpeg, libpng, etc.). Then build and install locally.  

4. **Try using Docker**  
   - If direct installation proves too difficult, containerizing your application can isolate the environment. For example, use an Amazon Linux 2 or another distro–based container that already has wkhtmltopdf installed (or can install it easily). Your Node.js app in that container can call wkhtmltopdf internally without worrying about host OS library differences.

5. **Hacky fallback: create a symlink to libpng16**  
   - Not recommended for production, but in a pinch some people try symlinking `libpng16.so.16` to `libpng15.so.15`. E.g.:
     ```
     sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/libpng16.so.16 /usr/lib64/libpng15.so.15
     ```
   - This *might* let the binary start, but can cause unpredictable behavior or crashes if the library ABI changed. Only consider this a temporary workaround to test if the rest of your pipeline works.

---

### Suggested Path
- **Best**: Use a prebuilt wkhtmltopdf binary specifically targeting Amazon Linux 2023 or a statically compiled release.  
- **Fallback**: Dockerize or build from source if no suitable precompiled package is readily available.  
- **Last resort**: Attempt a library symlink as a temporary hack, then transition to a proper fix (new binary or Docker container).
