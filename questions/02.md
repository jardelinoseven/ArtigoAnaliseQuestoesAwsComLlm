Wkhtmltopdf Not Working on Amazon Linux 2023

I installed wkhtmltox-0.12.6-1.amazonlinux2.x86_64.rpm on my EC2 instance(t3.xlarge). While using wkhtmltopdf in Node.js, I'm getting the following error:
Error generating PDF: Error: wkhtmltopdf: error while loading shared libraries: libpng15.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory wkhtmltopdf exited with code 127 at handleError (/var/www/html/Transectra/node_modules/wkhtmltopdf/index.js:161:16) at ChildProcess.<anonymous> (/var/www/html/Transectra/node_modules/wkhtmltopdf/index.js:133:7) at ChildProcess.emit (node:events:517:28) at ChildProcess._handle.onexit (node:internal/child_process:292:12)
I tried to install libpng15 but can't able to install it, but I only want this wkhtmltopdf library

## Q

To help troubleshoot this issue with wkhtmltopdf on your Amazon Linux 2023 EC2 instance, I'd like to check the health of your EC2 resources. Can you please provide the following information:

1. The AWS region where your EC2 instance is running (e.g., us-east-1)
2. The instance ID of your t3.xlarge EC2 instance
3. The approximate time window when you encountered this error (please narrow it down to less than 30 minutes if possible)

If you're not sure about any of these details, just let me know, and I'll look at all the metrics in the AWS/EC2 namespace for the last 30 minutes in your current region.
