How to avoid AWSEBAutoScalingLaunchConfiguration when creating a new AWS Elastin Beanstalk application?

Trying to create a AWS Elastic Beanstalk app with Docker running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2023/4.3.8, using pretty much default settings on most configuration settings, like these:
- IMDSv1 Deactivated
- Environment type Single instance
- Availability Zones Any
- Fleet composition On-Demand instance
- Instance types t3.microm
- On-demand base 0
- Proxy server nginx

The environment does not want to start though while I am seeing these error events:

 1. Creating Auto Scaling launch configuration failed Reason: Resource
    handler returned message: "The Launch Configuration creation
    operation is not available in your account. Use launch templates to
    create configuration templates for your Auto Scaling groups.
    (Service: AutoScaling, Status Code: 400, Request ID:
    e4a071d6-34d4-411f-92da-6d19cf888015)" (RequestToken:
    a2c39556-2bdd-3403-341a-1679bcb4a272, HandlerErrorCode:
    GeneralServiceException)
    

2. Stack named 'awseb-e-ex3sx4wzyp-stack' aborted operation. Current state: 'CREATE_FAILED' Reason: The following resource(s)
    failed to create: [AWSEBAutoScalingLaunchConfiguration].
    
3. Service:AmazonCloudFormation, Message:Resource AWSEBAutoScalingGroup does not exist for stack
    awseb-e-ex3sx4wzyp-stack

The user has admin rights. Any help appreciated :)

EDIT: I did follow an advice and added autoscaling:CreateLaunchConfiguration permission to the user that creates the app. The problem persists.

## Baseline answer 

for temporary fix we can use the below way to create the aws beanstalk environment 

EnableSpot option set to true. For more information, see Spot instance support and Configuration Auto Scaling group configuration .

### **Fixing "AWSEBAutoScalingLaunchConfiguration" Error in AWS Elastic Beanstalk**

You're encountering an error where **Elastic Beanstalk fails to create an Auto Scaling launch configuration**. The key issue in the error message is:

```
The Launch Configuration creation operation is not available in your account. Use launch templates to create configuration templates for your Auto Scaling groups.
```

This indicates that **AWS no longer supports Launch Configurations** in some newer accounts and requires **Launch Templates instead**.

---

## **Solution: Use Launch Templates Instead of Launch Configurations**
### **Step 1: Modify the Beanstalk Environment to Use Launch Templates**
Instead of using **Auto Scaling Launch Configurations**, you must configure Elastic Beanstalk to use **Launch Templates**.

#### **Option 1: Modify the Elastic Beanstalk Configuration (`.ebextensions`)**
If you're deploying using a `.ebextensions` configuration file, update it to specify a **Launch Template** instead of a **Launch Configuration**.

Create or modify a file **`.ebextensions/launch-template.config`**:
```yaml
Resources:
  AWSEBAutoScalingGroup:
    Type: AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup
    Properties:
      LaunchTemplate:
        LaunchTemplateId: !Ref MyLaunchTemplate
        Version: !GetAtt MyLaunchTemplate.LatestVersionNumber

  MyLaunchTemplate:
    Type: AWS::EC2::LaunchTemplate
    Properties:
      LaunchTemplateName: MyEBLaunchTemplate
      LaunchTemplateData:
        InstanceType: t3.micro
        ImageId: ami-xxxxxxxxxx  # Use the latest Amazon Linux 2023 AMI
        KeyName: my-key-pair
        SecurityGroupIds:
          - sg-xxxxxxxxxx  # Ensure the correct security group is attached
```
âœ… **Why?**  
This forces Elastic Beanstalk to use **Launch Templates**, avoiding the deprecated **Launch Configurations**.

---

### **Step 2: Use AWS CLI to Configure Beanstalk with a Launch Template**
If you don't want to modify `.ebextensions`, use the **AWS CLI** to configure the environment with **Launch Templates**.

1. **Create a Launch Template:**
```sh
aws ec2 create-launch-template --launch-template-name MyEBLaunchTemplate --launch-template-data '{"InstanceType":"t3.micro","ImageId":"ami-xxxxxxxxxx"}'
```
2. **Update Beanstalk Environment to Use Launch Templates:**
```sh
aws elasticbeanstalk update-environment --environment-name MyEBEnvironment --option-settings Namespace=aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration,OptionName=UseLaunchTemplate,Value=true
```
âœ… **Why?**  
- This explicitly tells AWS Beanstalk to use **Launch Templates** instead of **Launch Configurations**.

---

### **Step 3: Confirm IAM Permissions for Launch Templates**
Since Launch Configurations are deprecated, your IAM user needs the correct permissions for **Launch Templates**.

#### **Add This Policy to the IAM Role/User Creating the Beanstalk App**
```json
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "autoscaling:CreateLaunchTemplate",
        "autoscaling:CreateAutoScalingGroup",
        "ec2:RunInstances",
        "ec2:DescribeLaunchTemplates",
        "ec2:DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions",
        "elasticbeanstalk:UpdateEnvironment"
    ],
    "Resource": "*"
}
```
âœ… **Why?**  
This ensures the user can **create and manage Launch Templates**.

---

## **Solution 2: Deploy in a Region That Still Supports Launch Configurations**
Some **older AWS regions still allow Launch Configurations**. Check AWS documentation or try deploying in **us-east-1 or eu-west-1**.

---

## **Final Checklist**
| **Issue** | **Solution** |
|-----------|-------------|
| **AWS No Longer Supports Launch Configurations** | Use **Launch Templates** instead (`.ebextensions` or AWS CLI) |
| **Elastic Beanstalk is Still Trying to Use Launch Configurations** | Run `aws elasticbeanstalk update-environment --option-settings ...` |
| **IAM Role Lacks Permissions** | Add permissions for `autoscaling:CreateLaunchTemplate` |
| **Still Not Working?** | Try deploying in an **older AWS region** |

---

## **Final Recommendation**
1. **Update Elastic Beanstalk to use Launch Templates** (`.ebextensions` or CLI).  
2. **Ensure IAM permissions allow creating Launch Templates**.  
3. **Try deploying in a different AWS region (e.g., `us-east-1`)** if needed.  

ðŸš€ **After applying these fixes, your Beanstalk app should deploy successfully!** ðŸš€ Let me know if you need additional debugging help. âœ…

The core issue is that AWS Elastic Beanstalk (EB) is attempting to create an `AWSEBAutoScalingLaunchConfiguration`, which is deprecated in favor of Launch Templates, and the user's AWS account likely has been updated to require Launch Templates. This is indicated by the error message: "The Launch Configuration creation operation is not available in your account."

Here's a breakdown of the problem and the solutions:

**Understanding the Problem:**

* **Deprecated Launch Configurations:**
    * AWS is moving away from Launch Configurations and encouraging the use of Launch Templates for Auto Scaling groups.
    * Newer AWS accounts or accounts with updated configurations might have Launch Configuration creation disabled.
* **Elastic Beanstalk Configuration:**
    * Elastic Beanstalk, by default, might be attempting to use Launch Configurations in certain scenarios, even with single instance environments.
* **Permissions:**
    * Adding `autoscaling:CreateLaunchConfiguration` permissions will not resolve the issue, as the API itself is disabled.

**Solutions:**

1.  **Use Launch Templates (Recommended):**

    * The most reliable solution is to configure Elastic Beanstalk to use Launch Templates instead of Launch Configurations.
    * **Through the EB Console:**
        * When creating or modifying your EB environment, look for the "Configuration" section.
        * Navigate to "Instances" or "Scaling."
        * There should be an option to specify a Launch Template.
        * If there is not an option to specify a launch template directly, you may have to create a custom configuration file.
    * **Through Configuration Files (.ebextensions):**
        * You can create a `.ebextensions` configuration file to explicitly specify a Launch Template.
        * Example `.ebextensions/launch-template.config`:

        ```yaml
        option_settings:
          aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration:
            LaunchTemplateName: "YourLaunchTemplateName"
            LaunchTemplateVersion: "1"
        ```

        * Replace `"YourLaunchTemplateName"` with the name of your Launch Template.
        * You will need to create a launch template in the ec2 console.
        * After creating the launch template, ensure that the security groups and instance types in the launch template match what you want your EB environment to use.
        * Deploy this file with your application source code.

2.  **Verify Elastic Beanstalk Platform Version:**

    * Ensure you are using the latest Elastic Beanstalk platform version for your chosen environment (Docker on 64bit Amazon Linux 2023).
    * Newer platform versions are more likely to support Launch Templates by default.
    * Update the platform version from the EB console.

3.  **Check AWS Account Settings:**

    * While less likely, there might be specific account-level settings that enforce Launch Template usage.
    * If you have AWS Organizations or Service Control Policies (SCPs) in place, review them for any restrictions on Launch Configurations.

4.  **Single Instance Environment Clarification:**

    * Even though you are using a single instance environment, EB still uses autoscaling behind the scenes.
    * That is why the launch configuration is still created.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1.  **Create a Launch Template in the EC2 console.**
2.  **Use `.ebextensions` to configure Elastic Beanstalk to use the Launch Template.**
3.  **Verify that the platform version of EB is the latest available.**
4.  **Review AWS account settings and SCPs.**
5.  **Redeploy your Elastic Beanstalk application.**

By using Launch Templates, you can bypass the deprecated Launch Configuration creation and resolve the error.
