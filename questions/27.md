## [Question 27 (Oct 22, 2024)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79114902/how-to-avoid-awsebautoscalinglaunchconfiguration-when-creating-a-new-aws-elastin)

How to avoid AWSEBAutoScalingLaunchConfiguration when creating a new AWS Elastin Beanstalk application?

Trying to create a AWS Elastic Beanstalk app with Docker running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2023/4.3.8, using pretty much default settings on most configuration settings, like these:
- IMDSv1 Deactivated
- Environment type Single instance
- Availability Zones Any
- Fleet composition On-Demand instance
- Instance types t3.microm
- On-demand base 0
- Proxy server nginx

The environment does not want to start though while I am seeing these error events:

 1. Creating Auto Scaling launch configuration failed Reason: Resource
    handler returned message: "The Launch Configuration creation
    operation is not available in your account. Use launch templates to
    create configuration templates for your Auto Scaling groups.
    (Service: AutoScaling, Status Code: 400, Request ID:

    a2c39556-2bdd-3403-341a-1679bcb4a272, HandlerErrorCode:
    GeneralServiceException)
    

2. Stack named 'awseb-e-ex3sx4wzyp-stack' aborted operation. Current state: 'CREATE_FAILED' Reason: The following resource(s)
    failed to create: [AWSEBAutoScalingLaunchConfiguration].
    
3. Service:AmazonCloudFormation, Message:Resource AWSEBAutoScalingGroup does not exist for stack
    awseb-e-ex3sx4wzyp-stack

The user has admin rights. Any help appreciated :)

EDIT: I did follow an advice and added autoscaling:CreateLaunchConfiguration permission to the user that creates the app. The problem persists.

## Baseline answer 

for temporary fix we can use the below way to create the aws beanstalk environment 

EnableSpot option set to true. For more information, see Spot instance support and Configuration Auto Scaling group configuration .

### **Fixing "AWSEBAutoScalingLaunchConfiguration" Error in AWS Elastic Beanstalk**

You're encountering an error where **Elastic Beanstalk fails to create an Auto Scaling launch configuration**. The key issue in the error message is:

```
The Launch Configuration creation operation is not available in your account. Use launch templates to create configuration templates for your Auto Scaling groups.
```

This indicates that **AWS no longer supports Launch Configurations** in some newer accounts and requires **Launch Templates instead**.

---

## **Solution: Use Launch Templates Instead of Launch Configurations**
### **Step 1: Modify the Beanstalk Environment to Use Launch Templates**
Instead of using **Auto Scaling Launch Configurations**, you must configure Elastic Beanstalk to use **Launch Templates**.

#### **Option 1: Modify the Elastic Beanstalk Configuration (`.ebextensions`)**
If you're deploying using a `.ebextensions` configuration file, update it to specify a **Launch Template** instead of a **Launch Configuration**.

Create or modify a file **`.ebextensions/launch-template.config`**:
```yaml
Resources:
  AWSEBAutoScalingGroup:
    Type: AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup
    Properties:
      LaunchTemplate:
        LaunchTemplateId: !Ref MyLaunchTemplate
        Version: !GetAtt MyLaunchTemplate.LatestVersionNumber

  MyLaunchTemplate:
    Type: AWS::EC2::LaunchTemplate
    Properties:
      LaunchTemplateName: MyEBLaunchTemplate
      LaunchTemplateData:
        InstanceType: t3.micro
        ImageId: ami-xxxxxxxxxx  # Use the latest Amazon Linux 2023 AMI
        KeyName: my-key-pair
        SecurityGroupIds:
          - sg-xxxxxxxxxx  # Ensure the correct security group is attached
```
✅ **Why?**  
This forces Elastic Beanstalk to use **Launch Templates**, avoiding the deprecated **Launch Configurations**.

---

### **Step 2: Use AWS CLI to Configure Beanstalk with a Launch Template**
If you don't want to modify `.ebextensions`, use the **AWS CLI** to configure the environment with **Launch Templates**.

1. **Create a Launch Template:**
```sh
aws ec2 create-launch-template --launch-template-name MyEBLaunchTemplate --launch-template-data '{"InstanceType":"t3.micro","ImageId":"ami-xxxxxxxxxx"}'
```
2. **Update Beanstalk Environment to Use Launch Templates:**
```sh
aws elasticbeanstalk update-environment --environment-name MyEBEnvironment --option-settings Namespace=aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration,OptionName=UseLaunchTemplate,Value=true
```
✅ **Why?**  
- This explicitly tells AWS Beanstalk to use **Launch Templates** instead of **Launch Configurations**.

---

### **Step 3: Confirm IAM Permissions for Launch Templates**
Since Launch Configurations are deprecated, your IAM user needs the correct permissions for **Launch Templates**.

#### **Add This Policy to the IAM Role/User Creating the Beanstalk App**
```json
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "autoscaling:CreateLaunchTemplate",
        "autoscaling:CreateAutoScalingGroup",
        "ec2:RunInstances",
        "ec2:DescribeLaunchTemplates",
        "ec2:DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions",
        "elasticbeanstalk:UpdateEnvironment"
    ],
    "Resource": "*"
}
```
✅ **Why?**  
This ensures the user can **create and manage Launch Templates**.

---

## **Solution 2: Deploy in a Region That Still Supports Launch Configurations**
Some **older AWS regions still allow Launch Configurations**. Check AWS documentation or try deploying in **us-east-1 or eu-west-1**.

---

## **Final Checklist**
| **Issue** | **Solution** |
|-----------|-------------|
| **AWS No Longer Supports Launch Configurations** | Use **Launch Templates** instead (`.ebextensions` or AWS CLI) |
| **Elastic Beanstalk is Still Trying to Use Launch Configurations** | Run `aws elasticbeanstalk update-environment --option-settings ...` |
| **IAM Role Lacks Permissions** | Add permissions for `autoscaling:CreateLaunchTemplate` |
| **Still Not Working?** | Try deploying in an **older AWS region** |

---

## **Final Recommendation**
1. **Update Elastic Beanstalk to use Launch Templates** (`.ebextensions` or CLI).  
2. **Ensure IAM permissions allow creating Launch Templates**.  
3. **Try deploying in a different AWS region (e.g., `us-east-1`)** if needed.  

🚀 **After applying these fixes, your Beanstalk app should deploy successfully!** 🚀 Let me know if you need additional debugging help. ✅


## Gemini

The core issue is that AWS Elastic Beanstalk (EB) is attempting to create an `AWSEBAutoScalingLaunchConfiguration`, which is deprecated in favor of Launch Templates, and the user's AWS account likely has been updated to require Launch Templates. This is indicated by the error message: "The Launch Configuration creation operation is not available in your account."

Here's a breakdown of the problem and the solutions:

**Understanding the Problem:**

* **Deprecated Launch Configurations:**
    * AWS is moving away from Launch Configurations and encouraging the use of Launch Templates for Auto Scaling groups.
    * Newer AWS accounts or accounts with updated configurations might have Launch Configuration creation disabled.
* **Elastic Beanstalk Configuration:**
    * Elastic Beanstalk, by default, might be attempting to use Launch Configurations in certain scenarios, even with single instance environments.
* **Permissions:**
    * Adding `autoscaling:CreateLaunchConfiguration` permissions will not resolve the issue, as the API itself is disabled.

**Solutions:**

1.  **Use Launch Templates (Recommended):**

    * The most reliable solution is to configure Elastic Beanstalk to use Launch Templates instead of Launch Configurations.
    * **Through the EB Console:**
        * When creating or modifying your EB environment, look for the "Configuration" section.
        * Navigate to "Instances" or "Scaling."
        * There should be an option to specify a Launch Template.
        * If there is not an option to specify a launch template directly, you may have to create a custom configuration file.
    * **Through Configuration Files (.ebextensions):**
        * You can create a `.ebextensions` configuration file to explicitly specify a Launch Template.
        * Example `.ebextensions/launch-template.config`:

        ```yaml
        option_settings:
          aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration:
            LaunchTemplateName: "YourLaunchTemplateName"
            LaunchTemplateVersion: "1"
        ```

        * Replace `"YourLaunchTemplateName"` with the name of your Launch Template.
        * You will need to create a launch template in the ec2 console.
        * After creating the launch template, ensure that the security groups and instance types in the launch template match what you want your EB environment to use.
        * Deploy this file with your application source code.

2.  **Verify Elastic Beanstalk Platform Version:**

    * Ensure you are using the latest Elastic Beanstalk platform version for your chosen environment (Docker on 64bit Amazon Linux 2023).
    * Newer platform versions are more likely to support Launch Templates by default.
    * Update the platform version from the EB console.

3.  **Check AWS Account Settings:**

    * While less likely, there might be specific account-level settings that enforce Launch Template usage.
    * If you have AWS Organizations or Service Control Policies (SCPs) in place, review them for any restrictions on Launch Configurations.

4.  **Single Instance Environment Clarification:**

    * Even though you are using a single instance environment, EB still uses autoscaling behind the scenes.
    * That is why the launch configuration is still created.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1.  **Create a Launch Template in the EC2 console.**
2.  **Use `.ebextensions` to configure Elastic Beanstalk to use the Launch Template.**
3.  **Verify that the platform version of EB is the latest available.**
4.  **Review AWS account settings and SCPs.**
5.  **Redeploy your Elastic Beanstalk application.**

By using Launch Templates, you can bypass the deprecated Launch Configuration creation and resolve the error.

To resolve the **"AWSEBAutoScalingLaunchConfiguration" error** in AWS Elastic Beanstalk, follow these steps:

---

### **1. Use Launch Templates Instead of Legacy Launch Configurations**
AWS has deprecated Auto Scaling Launch Configurations in some accounts/regions. Force Elastic Beanstalk to use **Launch Templates**:

#### **Option A: Configure via `.ebextensions`**  
Create a `.ebextensions/launch-template.config` file in your app source code:
```yaml
Resources:
  AWSEBAutoScalingLaunchTemplate:
    Type: AWS::EC2::LaunchTemplate
    Properties:
      LaunchTemplateName: "my-beanstalk-lt"
      LaunchTemplateData:
        InstanceType: t3.micro
        ImageId: ami-0abcdef1234567890  # Amazon Linux 2023 AMI
        SecurityGroupIds:
          - sg-0123456789abcdef0

option_settings:
  - namespace: aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration
    option_name: InstanceType
    value: t3.micro
  - namespace: aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration
    option_name: LaunchTemplate
    value: "my-beanstalk-lt"
```

#### **Option B: Use AWS CLI to Force Launch Templates**
Update your environment settings:
```bash
aws elasticbeanstalk update-environment \
  --environment-name your-env-name \
  --option-settings \
    Namespace=aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration,OptionName=LaunchTemplate,Value=my-beanstalk-lt
```

---

### **2. Verify IAM Permissions**
Ensure your Elastic Beanstalk service role has:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "autoscaling:CreateLaunchTemplate",
        "autoscaling:DeleteLaunchTemplate",
        "ec2:RunInstances",
        "ec2:CreateLaunchTemplate"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### **3. Recreate the Environment**
Delete the failed environment and redeploy with:
```bash
eb create --cfg v2-launch-template
```

---

### **4. Alternative Workaround (Single Instance)**
If you don't need scaling, disable Auto Scaling entirely:
```yaml
# .ebextensions/disable-autoscaling.config
option_settings:
  - namespace: aws:elasticbeanstalk:environment
    option_name: EnvironmentType
    value: SingleInstance
  - namespace: aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration
    option_name: InstanceType
    value: t3.micro
```

---

### **Why This Happens**
- AWS is phasing out legacy Auto Scaling Launch Configurations in favor of Launch Templates
- Elastic Beanstalk defaults to Launch Configurations unless explicitly configured otherwise
- Recent accounts/regions block Launch Configuration creation

---

### **Final Checks**
1. Confirm `ImageId` in the Launch Template matches a valid Amazon Linux 2023 AMI for your region
2. Validate the `.ebextensions` folder is at the root of your app source bundle
3. Monitor CloudFormation events after redeploying

By migrating to Launch Templates, you'll resolve the compatibility issue while maintaining Elastic Beanstalk's managed infrastructure benefits. Let me know if you need help with AMI IDs or permissions! 🚀

## ChatGPT o1

AWS accounts created after mid‐2023 often have the older “launch configuration” APIs disabled by default in favor of the newer “launch templates.” However, Elastic Beanstalk currently tries to create an **Auto Scaling launch configuration** in certain situations (e.g., single‐instance environment, or certain platform versions), which triggers the “Launch Configuration creation operation is not available in your account” error.

Below are some ways to work around this limitation so your Amazon Linux 2023 Docker environment can launch successfully.

---

## 1) Use a Load-Balanced Environment Type (Instead of Single Instance)

In many cases, **Elastic Beanstalk uses a launch template for load‐balanced** environment types, but still attempts to use a launch configuration for single‐instance environments. If you can switch to the **load-balanced** environment type, you typically avoid the creation of a launch configuration. That often resolves the error immediately. For example:

1. In the EB console “Create environment” wizard, choose “Web server environment.”
2. Under “Environment type,” select “Load balanced.”
3. Keep your Docker on AL2023 platform.

This approach should cause EB to create an Auto Scaling group with a **launch template** instead of a launch configuration.

---

## 2) Use a Different Platform or Amazon Linux 2

If you don’t require Amazon Linux 2023 specifically, switching to an older platform like **“Docker running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2”** can also bypass the need for a launch configuration, because the AL2 Docker platform has more mature support for launch templates in single‐instance mode. While not guaranteed for all accounts, many find that Amazon Linux 2 EB platforms produce a launch template automatically.

---

## 3) Ask AWS Support to Re‐Enable Launch Configurations

If you really want a single‐instance environment on AL2023 Docker and can’t use ALB or AL2, you can open a **support case** and request that the **“LaunchConfiguration”** API be re‐enabled on your account. Some new or specialized AWS accounts have them restricted by default.

- In the AWS console, go to **Support** → **Support Center** → **Create case**.  
- Request re‐enabling or an exception for the older Auto Scaling Launch Configuration APIs.  
- Provide the environment ID or error message, so they know exactly why you need it.

---

## 4) Use a Custom EB Extension (Advanced)

In theory, you can override the EB environment’s capacity settings by adding a `.platform` or `.ebextensions` config that **forces** usage of a launch template. However, Amazon Linux 2023 is still in a fairly new state on EB, so this approach can get tricky and may require complex CloudFormation overrides.

---

### Summary

- **Best bet**: Switch to a load‐balanced environment (so EB uses launch templates).  
- Or use **Amazon Linux 2** (which usually doesn’t require a Launch Configuration in single‐instance mode).  
- If you must use AL2023 + single instance, request that AWS re‐enable Launch Configurations for your account.  

This avoids the “Creating Auto Scaling launch configuration failed” and “The Launch Configuration creation operation is not available in your account” errors, allowing your Docker on Amazon Linux 2023 environment to launch successfully.

## Analysis 

Note: The five LLMs have been anonymized in the analysis below, as follows: ChatGPT-4o is Chatbot #1, Gemini 2.0 Flash is Chatbot #2, Q is Chatbot #3, DeepSeek R1 is Chatbot #4 and ChatGPT-o1 is Chatbot #5

Below is a detailed comparative analysis of each chatbot response relative to the baseline Stack Overflow answer. The baseline suggests a “temporary fix” via enabling Spot instance support (which effectively forces the use of launch templates instead of the legacy launch configurations) for AWS Elastic Beanstalk. It references the AWS documentation that discusses configuration for Auto Scaling groups with Spot Instances, implying that some accounts or environments cannot create “launch configurations” and must use launch templates instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Baseline Answer (for reference)

> “For a temporary fix we can use the below way to create the AWS Beanstalk environment:
>
> EnableSpot option set to true...
>
> [Links to AWS docs about using Spot instances and launching with auto scaling group configuration]
>
> This effectively avoids using a Launch Configuration by forcing the environment to rely on a launch template.”

In short, the baseline highlights that some AWS accounts no longer allow creating Launch Configurations; therefore, you must do something that triggers usage of Launch Templates. One recommended approach is enabling Spot instance support in the environment’s configuration.

  - Mentions that “enable Spot” is not specifically listed, but it does highlight ways to avoid the problem: switch to a load-balanced environment or Amazon Linux 2, or request AWS re-enable the older API.  
  - This is consistent with the core premise of Launch Configs being off-limits in newer accounts.  
  - **Rating**: **Satisfactory** (facts are correct).

### 2. Completeness
- **Analysis**  
  - It covers multiple angles: using a load-balanced environment, using an older platform, requesting AWS support re-enable Launch Config, or advanced `.ebextensions`.  
  - In practice, enabling Spot is akin to “if you do so, EB will create a launch template automatically.” That’s not explicitly stated here, but it’s an alternative approach.  
  - **Rating**: **Satisfactory** (this approach is fairly broad and addresses the single-instance environment constraints directly).

### 3. Clarity
- **Analysis**  
  - Well-organized with headings. Explains each workaround in a short paragraph.  
  - **Rating**: **Satisfactory** (the user can easily read and understand it).
