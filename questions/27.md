Get status of transfer job using an AWS transfer connector

Boto3 exposes this method: https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/transfer/client/start_file_transfer.html

for initiating an sftp transfer job. The method returns a TransferId, however the docs do not include a method that accepts that transfer-id to allow status polling. What is the best practice for doing so?

## Highest-scored answer 

The only way available, as of Nov 2023 is to check for the status of a file transfer initiated through a AWS transfer family SFTP connector is to monitor the cloud watch logs for updates regarding the file transfer. Connector activity is logged to log streams that have the format of aws/transfer/connector-id.

This is not be best way to check for status of file transfer but this is the only way available for now.

To get the status of a transfer job using the AWS Transfer Family service, you can use the `list_jobs` method provided by the Boto3 client. Although there isn't a direct method to poll the status using the TransferId, you can use the `list_jobs` method to retrieve the list of jobs and then filter it based on the TransferId.

Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

1. **Initialize the Boto3 client:**
   ```python
   import boto3

   client = boto3.client('transfer')
   ```

2. **List the jobs and filter by TransferId:**
   ```python
   def get_transfer_job_status(transfer_id):
       try:
           response = client.list_jobs()
           jobs = response['Jobs']

           # Filter jobs based on the TransferId
           for job in jobs:
               if job['TransferId'] == transfer_id:
                   return job['Status']

           return 'Transfer job not found'
       except Exception as e:
           return f"An error occurred: {str(e)}"

   # Replace 'your_transfer_id' with the actual TransferId
   transfer_id = 'your_transfer_id'
   status = get_transfer_job_status(transfer_id)
   print(f"Transfer job status: {status}")
   ```

This script initializes the Boto3 client for the Transfer Family service, retrieves the list of jobs, and filters the list to find the job with the specified TransferId. It then returns the status of the job.

### Best Practices
1. **Error Handling:** Ensure you have proper error handling in place to manage any exceptions that might occur during the API call.
2. **Pagination:** The `list_jobs` method may return a paginated response if there are many jobs. Be sure to handle pagination if necessary to retrieve all jobs.
3. **Efficiency:** If you have a large number of transfer jobs, it might be more efficient to implement a custom solution that tracks the job statuses immediately after they are created, rather than querying all jobs each time.

### Handling Pagination Example:
```python
def get_transfer_job_status(transfer_id):
    try:
        paginator = client.get_paginator('list_jobs')
        for page in paginator.paginate():
            jobs = page['Jobs']

            # Filter jobs based on the TransferId
            for job in jobs:
                if job['TransferId'] == transfer_id:
                    return job['Status']

        return 'Transfer job not found'
    except Exception as e:
        return f"An error occurred: {str(e)}"

# Replace 'your_transfer_id' with the actual TransferId
transfer_id = 'your_transfer_id'
status = get_transfer_job_status(transfer_id)
print(f"Transfer job status: {status}")
```

This example uses a paginator to handle cases where the number of jobs exceeds a single page of results.

In the AWS ecosystem, monitoring or polling the status of a file transfer initiated through AWS Transfer Family using Boto3 can be challenging because the `start_file_transfer` function, as you noted, does not directly provide a built-in method for status updates after initiating a transfer. 

Here are a few approaches you might consider to handle this situation:

1. **CloudWatch Events/Logs:**
   AWS Transfer Family integrates with Amazon CloudWatch to monitor and log events related to your transfers. When you start a file transfer, AWS Transfer Family can send event data such as start, end, and failure of file transfers to CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch Events. You can set up a CloudWatch Event rule that triggers on the log data indicating the completion or failure of a transfer job and directs this information to an AWS Lambda function, SNS topic, or another service. This way, you can programmatically respond to the transfer status.

2. **S3 Event Notifications:**
   If your transfer job involves uploading files to Amazon S3, you can configure S3 bucket notifications to send a notification (via SNS, SQS, or Lambda) when an object is created. Since the AWS Transfer Family service uploads files to S3, you can capture these events to indirectly monitor the status of your uploads.

3. **Custom Polling Logic:**
   If the above methods do not fit your use case, you could implement a custom polling mechanism. This involves:
   - Setting up your application to store the `TransferId` and periodically check the destination (like an S3 bucket or EFS file system) to see if the expected files appear or if their timestamp changes.
   - Using S3 or EFS APIs to check for file presence or file metadata updates can serve as an indirect indicator that a transfer has completed.

4. **AWS SDK and CLI Improvements:**
   Periodically check for updates or changes in the AWS SDK and CLI. AWS continuously improves its services and may provide a more direct method to check the status of a transfer job in the future.

5. **Feedback to AWS:**
   Consider providing feedback to AWS via the AWS forums or your AWS Support contact about this limitation. Requesting a feature that allows querying the transfer status by `TransferId` directly could lead to AWS prioritizing this addition based on customer feedback.

Combining these approaches based on your specific AWS environment and monitoring needs can help you effectively manage and track AWS file transfers.

Happy to help!
The document talks about how to start a file transfer job using boto3, but it does not discuss how to poll the status of a transfer job. You can use the describe_file_transfer API to poll the status of a transfer job using transferid. You can also use the wait_for_file_transfer API to wait for a transfer job to complete.
Let me know if you have other questions!


## Q

To get the status of an AWS Transfer Connector and the associated data transfer jobs, you can follow these steps:

1. Check the status of the Transfer Connector:
   - Open the AWS Transfer Family console and locate the Transfer Connector you want to check.
   - In the "Status" column, you will see the current status of the Transfer Connector, which can be "AVAILABLE", "CREATING", "DELETING", or "FAILED".
   - Alternatively, you can use the AWS CLI command `aws transfer describe-connector --connector-id <connector-id>` to get the status.

2. Check the status of a specific data transfer job:
   - Use the AWS CLI command `aws transfer describe-task-execution --task-execution-id <task-execution-id>` to get detailed information about a data transfer job, including its status.
   - The status can be one of the following: "PENDING", "IN_PROGRESS", "COMPLETED", "FAILED", or "CANCELLED".

3. Troubleshoot issues:
   - If the Transfer Connector or data transfer job has a "FAILED" status, check the "failure-code" and "failure-message" in the output to identify the root cause of the issue.
   - Refer to the [AWS Transfer Family documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/monitoring-and-troubleshooting.html) for more information on monitoring and troubleshooting.

Regarding the Boto3 API, the `start_file_transfer` method does not provide a way to directly retrieve the status of a data transfer job. However, you can use the `describe_task_execution` method to get the status of a specific job.

Here's an example of how you can use Boto3 to check the status of a data transfer job:

```python
import boto3

# Create a Transfer Family client
transfer_client = boto3.client('transfer')

# Start a file transfer
response = transfer_client.start_file_transfer(
    ConnectorId='<connector-id>',
    SendFilePaths=['<source-file-path>']
)

# Get the task execution ID
task_execution_id = response['TaskExecutionId']

# Check the status of the data transfer job
task_status = transfer_client.describe_task_execution(
    TaskExecutionId=task_execution_id
)['Status']

print(f"Data transfer job status: {task_status}")
```

Remember to replace `<connector-id>` and `<source-file-path>` with the appropriate values for your use case.
