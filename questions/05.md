## [Question 5 (Nov 5, 2024)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79160921/r-random-numbers-almost-the-same-but-not-identical)

R random numbers almost the same but not identical
Running the same version of R, one on a Linux R server and one on AWS, the RNG is almost the same, but not always identical. Out of 1 million samples from the uniform, gamma, and Normal distributions respectively:

runif() produces identical results.
rgamma() produces 7 small differences; otherwise identical results.
rnorm() also produces 7 small differences; otherwise identical results.
By small differences, I mean something like 1.4510448921274106 vs 1.4510448921274115.

What would be causing these differences? If a floating point issue, why only some distributions? If an OS/library/software issue, why only different on rare occasions?


## Highest-scored answer 

runif() is not implemented in floating point; it's doing integer arithmetic internally (at least for the default Mersenne-Twister algorithm, and probably for all the available algorithms). You can see the code for Mersenne Twister [here](https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/333d192c97e93a4003b020315f8fecd58df08da9/src/main/RNG.c#L625-L726); in particular, you can see that the result is only converted to double-precision floating point at the very end (line 725). So it is not subject to cross-platform/cross-compiler floating-point artifacts.

As for "why [are the others] only different on rare occasions?"; I assume that the rgamma() and rnorm() implementations are relatively numerically stable, so that the possibilities for differential floating-point/roundoff error are rare â€” especially if the differences have to do only with the use of [80-bit registers for intermediate computations](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/612507/what-are-the-applications-benefits-of-an-80-bit-extended-precision-data-type) (vs the default 64-bit precision).

## Q

The issue you're experiencing with random number generation in R across different environments (Linux R server and AWS) is likely due to subtle differences in the underlying hardware, operating systems, or libraries used by R. Here are some possible explanations and suggestions to address this:

1. Floating-point precision: The small differences you're seeing (e.g., 1.4510448921274106 vs 1.4510448921274115) are likely due to floating-point arithmetic differences between the two systems. This can occur due to variations in hardware architecture, compiler optimizations, or mathematical libraries.

2. RNG implementation: While R strives for consistency across platforms, there can be slight variations in the random number generator (RNG) implementation due to system-specific optimizations or libraries.

3. Distribution-specific algorithms: The fact that you're seeing differences in rgamma() and rnorm() but not in runif() suggests that the algorithms for these specific distributions might be more susceptible to system-level variations.

To address this issue and ensure consistency across environments, you can try the following:

1. Set a specific seed: Use set.seed() before generating random numbers to ensure reproducibility across systems. For example:

   ```R
   set.seed(123)
   # Your random number generation code here
   ```

2. Use RNGkind(): Specify the RNG algorithm explicitly to ensure consistency:

   ```R
   RNGkind("Mersenne-Twister", "Inversion", "Rejection")
   set.seed(123)
   # Your random number generation code here
   ```

3. Version control: Ensure you're using the exact same version of R and relevant packages on both systems.

4. Environment variables: Check if there are any R-related environment variables set differently on the two systems that might affect RNG behavior.

5. Compiler options: If you're compiling R from source, ensure the same compiler options are used on both systems.

6. Use high-precision libraries: For critical applications requiring exact reproducibility, consider using high-precision arithmetic libraries or packages designed for reproducible research.

7. Document and version control your entire environment: Use tools like renv or packrat to ensure package versions are consistent across systems.

To verify if the problem has been solved:

1. Generate a large number of random values on both systems using the same seed.
2. Compare the results using a hash function or by directly comparing the values.
3. If the results are identical, the issue has been resolved.

If the problem persists after trying these solutions, it may be worth reaching out to the R community forums or consulting with AWS support for more specific guidance related to your AWS environment.
