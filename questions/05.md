## [Question 5 (Nov 5, 2024)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79160921/r-random-numbers-almost-the-same-but-not-identical)

R random numbers almost the same but not identical
Running the same version of R, one on a Linux R server and one on AWS, the RNG is almost the same, but not always identical. Out of 1 million samples from the uniform, gamma, and Normal distributions respectively:

runif() produces identical results.
rgamma() produces 7 small differences; otherwise identical results.
rnorm() also produces 7 small differences; otherwise identical results.
By small differences, I mean something like 1.4510448921274106 vs 1.4510448921274115.

What would be causing these differences? If a floating point issue, why only some distributions? If an OS/library/software issue, why only different on rare occasions?


## Highest-scored answer 

runif() is not implemented in floating point; it's doing integer arithmetic internally (at least for the default Mersenne-Twister algorithm, and probably for all the available algorithms). You can see the code for Mersenne Twister [here](https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/333d192c97e93a4003b020315f8fecd58df08da9/src/main/RNG.c#L625-L726); in particular, you can see that the result is only converted to double-precision floating point at the very end (line 725). So it is not subject to cross-platform/cross-compiler floating-point artifacts.

As for "why [are the others] only different on rare occasions?"; I assume that the rgamma() and rnorm() implementations are relatively numerically stable, so that the possibilities for differential floating-point/roundoff error are rare — especially if the differences have to do only with the use of [80-bit registers for intermediate computations](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/612507/what-are-the-applications-benefits-of-an-80-bit-extended-precision-data-type) (vs the default 64-bit precision).


## ChatGPT-4o

The small differences in **random number generation (RNG)** between **Linux R server** and **AWS R instance** are likely caused by one or more of the following:

---

## **1. Floating-Point Precision Differences (Architecture-Specific)**
- Even though you are using the **same version of R**, AWS instances may run on **different CPU architectures** (e.g., **Intel vs. AMD vs. ARM-based Graviton**).
- Different CPU architectures handle floating-point arithmetic slightly differently due to **hardware-level rounding behaviors**.
- This explains why differences are rare and affect only some distributions.

### **How to Check?**
Run this in both environments:
```r
.Platform$OS.type  # Check OS
.Machine$double.eps  # Smallest difference between two numbers (machine precision)
```

If these values differ, the differences in RNG output could be due to **hardware-based floating-point operations**.

---

## **2. RNG Implementation Differences Across Distributions**
- `runif()` produces **identical results**, meaning that the uniform RNG uses **only integer arithmetic** and is less affected by floating-point differences.
- `rgamma()` and `rnorm()` involve **more complex transformations** (Box-Muller for normal and rejection sampling for gamma), which depend on floating-point arithmetic.

### **How to Check?**
Try generating **raw integer seeds** to see if the discrepancy persists:
```r
set.seed(123)
runif(10)  # Check uniform
rgamma(10, shape = 2)  # Check gamma
rnorm(10)  # Check normal
```
Then compare outputs across both environments.

---

## **3. Underlying Math Library Differences (BLAS, LAPACK, or MKL)**
R uses **BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) and LAPACK** for numerical computations. If AWS is using an optimized version like **Intel MKL (Math Kernel Library)**, while your Linux R server is using **OpenBLAS**, this can cause small numerical variations.

### **How to Check?**
```r
sessionInfo()  # Look for MKL vs. OpenBLAS in linked libraries
```
OR
```sh
ldd $(R --slave -e 'cat(Sys.getenv("R_HOME"))')/lib/libR.so | grep blas
```

### **Solution**
If AWS uses **MKL** and you want consistency, force R to use OpenBLAS or a reference BLAS:
```sh
sudo update-alternatives --config libblas.so.3  # Choose OpenBLAS
```
OR use **R environment variables**:
```r
Sys.setenv("OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS" = "1")
```

---

## **4. Differences in Compilation of R**
If R was compiled **differently** on your Linux server vs. AWS, there might be subtle differences.

### **How to Check?**
Compare R's compilation details:
```r
version
```

If AWS shows a different **compiler (GCC, Clang)** or **optimization flags**, this could be the cause.

---

## **Conclusion**
| **Possible Cause** | **Likelihood** | **How to Check?** | **Solution** |
|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **CPU Architecture Differences (Intel/AMD/ARM)** | ✅ High | `.Machine$double.eps` | Use same instance type |
| **Different BLAS/LAPACK Libraries (MKL vs. OpenBLAS)** | ✅ High | `sessionInfo()` | Standardize BLAS library |
| **Floating-Point Precision (Hardware-Level Rounding)** | ✅ High | Run tests across OS | No perfect fix (use same CPU) |
| **Different R Compilation Options** | 🟡 Medium | `version` | Recompile R consistently |

If you **need bitwise-identical results**, try:
1. Running **R on identical CPU architectures**.
2. Ensuring **consistent BLAS/LAPACK libraries**.
3. Using **fixed precision libraries** like `Rmpfr` for critical computations.

## Gemini

This is a classic and subtle issue related to random number generation and floating-point precision across different environments. Here's a breakdown of the possible causes and solutions:

**1. Floating-Point Precision and Libraries:**

* **Underlying C/C++ Libraries:**
    * R relies on underlying C/C++ libraries (like the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) or platform-specific libraries) for random number generation. These libraries might have slight variations in implementation or compilation across different operating systems (Linux vs. AWS environment).
    * Even if the same algorithm is used, differences in how floating-point operations are handled at the CPU level can lead to tiny variations.
* **Floating-Point Arithmetic:**
    * Floating-point numbers have limited precision. The small differences you see are likely due to rounding errors that accumulate during the generation of random numbers.
    * The order of operations and the specific floating-point units used by the CPU can affect these rounding errors.
    * The gamma and normal distributions often involve more complex calculations than the uniform distribution, making them more susceptible to these differences.
* **CPU Architecture:**
    * Even if the same OS is used, differences in the underlying CPU architecture (e.g., different generations of Intel or AMD processors) can lead to subtle variations in floating-point calculations. AWS instances might use different CPU models than your local Linux server.

**2. R Version and Packages:**

* **R Version Differences (Even Minor):**
    * While you mentioned the same R version, even minor patch releases can introduce changes in the RNG or underlying libraries. Double-check the exact R version and build.
* **Package Dependencies:**
    * R packages that provide random number generation functions might have dependencies on system libraries. Differences in these dependencies can cause variations.
* **R's RNG Settings:**
    * R has a function `RNGkind()` that allows you to select the random number generator. It is very unlikely this is the issue, if the default is in use, but it is worth verifying that both systems are using the same generator.
    * Also the seed values used are critical. If the seed is not explicitly set, then the seed will be based on the time of the system, and therefore always different.

**3. Operating System and Environment:**

* **Operating System Differences:**
    * Even though you're using Linux on both, the specific distribution and kernel version can influence how libraries and floating-point operations are handled.
    * AWS uses virtualized hardware, that has an additional abstraction layer between the software, and the physical hardware.
* **Virtualization:**
    * If the AWS environment is virtualized, the virtualization layer itself can introduce subtle timing differences that affect random number generation.

**Solutions and Recommendations:**

1.  **Set the RNG Seed:**
    * The most crucial step is to explicitly set the random number generator seed using `set.seed()` before generating any random numbers. This will ensure that you get reproducible results on both systems, *provided* the underlying RNG implementation is identical.
    * ```R
        set.seed(123) # Use any integer seed
        rnorm(10)
        ```
2.  **Verify R and Package Versions:**
    * Use `R.version.string` and `packageVersion()` to confirm that you're using the exact same R version and package versions on both systems.
3.  **Check `RNGkind()`:**
    * Use `RNGkind()` to verify that both systems are using the same random number generator. If not, set them to the same value.
4.  **Tolerance for Differences:**
    * In many cases, the small differences you're seeing are negligible. If your application can tolerate these differences, you might not need to take any further action.
5.  **Consider Using a Consistent Environment:**
    * If reproducibility is critical, consider using Docker containers or virtual machines to create a consistent environment across your Linux server and AWS.
6.  **Investigate Underlying Libraries (Advanced):**
    * If you need absolute precision, you might need to delve into the underlying C/C++ libraries used by R and ensure that they are compiled with the same options and using the same compiler. This is generally only necessary in very specialized cases.
7. **Test on different AWS instance types:**
    * If the issue is suspected to be CPU related, test the code on multiple different AWS instance types, to see if the issue is present across all of them.

**Why Some Distributions Are More Affected:**

* The uniform distribution (runif()) typically involves simpler calculations.
* The gamma and normal distributions (rgamma(), rnorm()) often involve more complex mathematical functions (e.g., logarithms, exponentials, square roots), which can amplify rounding errors.

By focusing on setting the seed and verifying R and package versions, you can significantly improve the reproducibility of your random number generation.



## Q

The issue you're experiencing with random number generation in R across different environments (Linux R server and AWS) is likely due to subtle differences in the underlying hardware, operating systems, or libraries used by R. Here are some possible explanations and suggestions to address this:

1. Floating-point precision: The small differences you're seeing (e.g., 1.4510448921274106 vs 1.4510448921274115) are likely due to floating-point arithmetic differences between the two systems. This can occur due to variations in hardware architecture, compiler optimizations, or mathematical libraries.

2. RNG implementation: While R strives for consistency across platforms, there can be slight variations in the random number generator (RNG) implementation due to system-specific optimizations or libraries.

3. Distribution-specific algorithms: The fact that you're seeing differences in rgamma() and rnorm() but not in runif() suggests that the algorithms for these specific distributions might be more susceptible to system-level variations.

To address this issue and ensure consistency across environments, you can try the following:

1. Set a specific seed: Use set.seed() before generating random numbers to ensure reproducibility across systems. For example:

   ```R
   set.seed(123)
   # Your random number generation code here
   ```

2. Use RNGkind(): Specify the RNG algorithm explicitly to ensure consistency:

   ```R
   RNGkind("Mersenne-Twister", "Inversion", "Rejection")
   set.seed(123)
   # Your random number generation code here
   ```

3. Version control: Ensure you're using the exact same version of R and relevant packages on both systems.

4. Environment variables: Check if there are any R-related environment variables set differently on the two systems that might affect RNG behavior.

5. Compiler options: If you're compiling R from source, ensure the same compiler options are used on both systems.

6. Use high-precision libraries: For critical applications requiring exact reproducibility, consider using high-precision arithmetic libraries or packages designed for reproducible research.

7. Document and version control your entire environment: Use tools like renv or packrat to ensure package versions are consistent across systems.

To verify if the problem has been solved:

1. Generate a large number of random values on both systems using the same seed.
2. Compare the results using a hash function or by directly comparing the values.
3. If the results are identical, the issue has been resolved.

If the problem persists after trying these solutions, it may be worth reaching out to the R community forums or consulting with AWS support for more specific guidance related to your AWS environment.


## DeepSeek R1

The minor discrepancies in R’s `rgamma()` and `rnorm()` outputs (but not `runif()`) likely stem from **platform-specific floating-point optimizations** and **differences in math library implementations**. Here’s a breakdown of the causes and solutions:

---

### **Why This Happens**
1. **Floating-Point Precision Variations**:
   - **CPU Architectures**: AWS and your Linux server might use different CPUs (e.g., Intel vs. AMD) or compiler optimizations (`-O3`, `-ffast-math`), leading to tiny differences in floating-point operations.
   - **Math Libraries**: `rgamma()` and `rnorm()` rely on approximations (e.g., acceptance-rejection algorithms) that use system-specific libraries like `libm` or BLAS/LAPACK. Small rounding differences can propagate during iterative calculations.

2. **RNG Algorithm Edge Cases**:
   - Distributions like gamma and normal involve multi-step transformations (e.g., Box-Muller for normals), where minor numerical differences in intermediate steps amplify slightly in rare cases (e.g., values near algorithm branch points).

3. **`runif()` vs. Other Distributions**:
   - `runif()` directly maps RNG integers to floats, which is deterministic across platforms. Transformations for gamma/normal distributions involve more math operations, exposing platform-specific behavior.

---

### **Solutions to Ensure Reproducibility**
#### **1. Enforce Consistent Math Libraries**
Recompile R on both systems with **identical math libraries** (e.g., use the same BLAS/LAPACK version and disable CPU-specific optimizations):
```bash
# Example: Compile R with strict IEEE compliance
./configure --disable-float-reproducibility --with-blas="-lm" --with-lapack
```

#### **2. Use Strict Floating-Point Settings**
Force consistent floating-point behavior by setting environment variables:
```bash
# Disable CPU-specific optimizations
export LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libmathlib.so  # Use a consistent libm
export FLAGS_BEFORE="-frounding-math -fsignaling-nans"
```

#### **3. Use Reproducible RNG Methods**
Switch to RNG algorithms less sensitive to floating-point differences:
```r
# In R, use the "Inversion" method for normals (slower but reproducible)
RNGkind(normal.kind = "Inversion")
set.seed(123)
rnorm(10)
```

#### **4. Validate/Override R’s Distribution Code**
Bypass R’s native functions with custom, platform-agnostic implementations:
```r
# Example: Reproducible normal variates via qnorm(runif())
custom_rnorm <- function(n) {
  qnorm(runif(n))
}
custom_rnorm(10)  # Deterministic across platforms
```

#### **5. Align OS and Compiler Toolchains**
Ensure both systems use:
   - The same Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04 LTS).
   - Identical compiler versions (e.g., `gcc 12.3.0`).
   - Matching `libm` (e.g., `glibc 2.35`).

---

### **Why Only 7 Differences in 1 Million Samples?**
- **Edge Cases**: The discrepancies occur when values land near thresholds in distribution-specific algorithms (e.g., a gamma variate requiring many rejection steps).
- **Cumulative Rounding**: Tiny differences in intermediate steps (e.g., `log()` or `sqrt()`) compound in multi-stage algorithms.

---

### **Final Recommendation**
1. **Short-Term Fix**: Use `RNGkind(normal.kind = "Inversion")` and `RNGkind(gamma.kind = "Ahrens-Dieter")` to minimize platform sensitivity.
2. **Long-Term Fix**: Recompile R with strict floating-point settings on both systems.

By aligning math libraries and RNG methods, you can eliminate these discrepancies entirely.

## ChatGPT-o1

Below are the main reasons why you might see tiny, intermittent floating-point differences in R’s random draws across two systems, even when using the same R version and seed:

1. **Different math library implementations**  
   - R relies on various low-level mathematical routines (e.g., `log`, `exp`, etc.) from the OS or external libraries. Even small differences in how these libraries handle rounding or intermediate steps can produce slightly different floating-point results.  
   - `runif()` typically uses simple integer arithmetic and division, so it’s less susceptible to variation. In contrast, `rgamma()`, `rnorm()`, and other distributions involve more complex transformations (e.g., logs, exponentials, rejection sampling). Minor differences in the math library’s implementation can cause the small discrepancies you’re seeing.

2. **Different CPU hardware / instruction sets**  
   - Even if you’re running the “same version” of R, the CPU instructions used under the hood (vectorization, FMA instructions, extended precision registers, etc.) can differ between local Linux servers and AWS instances.  
   - A few values in a large sequence can “take a slightly different path” in extended precision registers, or produce a single rounding difference that propagates in the random sampling algorithm.

3. **Dynamic linking vs. static linking**  
   - If your local server’s R is dynamically linked to a particular version of glibc or another math library, and your AWS instance is linked to a slightly different version, you can see small floating-point deltas.  
   - Even if the version numbers match, small differences in how the libraries were compiled (e.g., compiler flags) can appear.

4. **R’s random number generator calls math functions**  
   - The RNG itself (the core uniform draws) can be bit-for-bit reproducible if you have the same R version and seed, but once you call distribution-specific functions, the transformations rely on floating-point operations.  
   - For `runif()`, it’s basically taking bits from the base RNG state and turning them into uniform values, so it’s almost always identical across systems.  
   - For `rgamma()` or `rnorm()`, which often use transforms (e.g., Box-Muller or other algorithms), the numeric subtleties of `log`, `sqrt`, `exp` can slightly differ.

5. **Why only “rare” differences?**  
   - Floating-point rounding differences often show up only when certain boundary conditions are hit—like extremely small or large intermediate values. In those cases, a single bit difference in rounding can change the final result by ~1e-15, which is what you’re seeing in your 7 out of 1 million samples.  

---

### Summary
- These slight discrepancies are almost certainly due to normal floating-point differences in the math libraries or CPU instructions used for gamma and normal distributions (and not the uniform).  
- They’re not an error or bug; just a manifestation of how floating-point arithmetic can differ slightly between environments.  
- If you truly need bit-for-bit reproducibility across systems, you generally must ensure the exact same math libraries (including version + build flags) and hardware instruction sets – but even then, subtle differences can creep in.  
- For most statistical and machine learning workflows, the magnitude of these differences is negligible.


## Analysis 

Note: The five LLMs have been anonymized in the analysis below, as follows: ChatGPT-4o is Chatbot #1, Gemini 2.0 Flash is Chatbot #2, Q is Chatbot #3, DeepSeek R1 is Chatbot #4 and ChatGPT-o1 is Chatbot #5

Below is a structured, side-by-side evaluation of each chatbot response relative to the **baseline answer**. The baseline states that:

- **`runif()`** is implemented mostly in integer arithmetic, so it avoids cross-platform floating-point artifacts.  
- **`rgamma()` and `rnorm()`** use more complex floating-point calculations (e.g., transformations or rejection sampling), thus are prone to occasional cross-platform differences (e.g., use of extended 80-bit registers on some systems).  

Hence, the key elements from the baseline are:

1. **Why `runif()` matches exactly**: Integer arithmetic for the Mersenne-Twister (or similar) RNG means fewer rounding issues.
2. **Why `rgamma()`/`rnorm()` differ rarely**: They rely on more floating-point operations; subtle differences in rounding/precision can occur across OSes/compilers/architectures.
3. **Mechanism**: Possibly due to extended-precision registers or other numeric “edge” differences.

# Overall Best Response
Most of the chatbots provide accurate, complete, and practical guidance. **Responses #1 and #4** are especially thorough, referencing multiple verification steps and solutions, and they explicitly highlight that `runif()` uses integer arithmetic and the floating-point transformations for `rnorm()`/`rgamma()` can differ. Each is well-organized and offers many practical tips.

- If we must pick a single best, **Chatbot #4** is arguably the most comprehensive: it explicitly delves into how normal and gamma sampling might differ, explains “why only 7 differences,” and gives advanced solutions (like specifying `RNGkind(...)`, recompile flags, custom distribution code, etc.).  

# Overall Worst Response
In reality, none is outright “poor.” Each hits the main points about floating-point differences.  
- **Chatbot #3** is slightly lighter on details about precisely *why* runif is unaffected (doesn’t mention integer arithmetic as explicitly). However, it still addresses the main cause (floating-point differences in other distributions) and suggests solutions.  
- Since we have to pick the “worst,” **Chatbot #3** is a bit less detailed than the others, but it’s still mostly correct.
