## [Question 5](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76638539/firebase-cloud-messaging-api-v1-aws-sns-platform-application)

I'm currently using FCM (legacy) to send push notifications to my customers' Android devices from AWS SNS by adding FCM as a platform endpoint.

I've recently received notification from Firebase that I need to update my application to the latest Firebase Cloud Messaging API, and migrate away from the legacy HTTP protocol to HTTP v1.

However, when trying to create a new / replacement Platform Application in AWS SNS console, I have to provide a server key - but I understand that server keys are only available for the legacy API.

Can anyone help me understand the protocol and process for migrating my existing AWS SNS to FCM platform integration to the new API, so that I can continue to send app notifications to my Android customers via AWS SNS once the FCM legacy HTTP protocol is deprecated?

### UPDATE January 2024:

Amazon SNS now supports Google FCM v1 API. It is now possible to create AWS SNS Android mobile push notifications via FCM v1 API when creating new SNS platform application. You can also upgrade your existing applications with a single call to the Amazon SNS SetPlatformApplicationAttributes API action.

AWS announcement regarding this update: https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/01/amazon-sns-fcm-http-v1-api-mobile-notifications/

### Original answer:

At the moment AWS SNS does not support Firebase Cloud Messaging API (V1). The old API should work until 20/06/2024. Since 20/06/2023 Google also deprecated legacy API and you cannot use it for new apps anymore. AWS teams are aware of this but we are still waiting for an update when they will integrate SNS with new FCM API as per this post:

https://repost.aws/questions/QUWxZXuxT3ShOrBGsTM0s9Ew/sns-uses-which-version-of-firebase-cloud-messaging-api

At the moment what you can do is:

1. Leave your platform running on legacy until 20/06/2024 and hope in the meantime AWS teams will implements new FCM APIv1 into SNS.
2. Create your own solution by omitting SNS completely and use FCM Admin SDK or HTTP REST APIv1 on your custom server environment to push notifications to Android devices. More documentation: https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/server

Migrating from the Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) legacy API to the new HTTP v1 API and integrating it with AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) involves several steps. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you with this process:

### Step 1: Set Up Firebase Cloud Messaging API (V1)

1. **Create a Firebase Project**:
   - If you don't have a Firebase project, create one in the Firebase Console.

2. **Enable Cloud Messaging API**:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Select your project.
   - Navigate to APIs & Services > Dashboard.
   - Enable the "Cloud Messaging API" for your project.

3. **Generate Service Account Key**:
   - In the Firebase Console, go to Project Settings > Service Accounts.
   - Click "Generate New Private Key" and download the JSON file. This file contains your service account credentials.

### Step 2: Update Your AWS SNS Platform Application

1. **Create a New Platform Application**:
   - In the AWS Management Console, go to SNS.
   - Navigate to Mobile > Push Notifications and create a new platform application.

2. **Configure Platform Application**:
   - Instead of using the server key (which is for the legacy API), use the service account JSON file for authentication.
   - Unfortunately, AWS SNS does not directly support FCM HTTP v1 API. This means you'll need to manage the integration yourself.

### Step 3: Implement Custom Logic for FCM HTTP v1 Integration

Since AWS SNS does not natively support FCM HTTP v1, you need to handle the sending of notifications to FCM directly from your application code. Here’s how you can do this:

1. **Install Firebase Admin SDK**:
   - Depending on your backend language, install the Firebase Admin SDK. Here is an example for Node.js:
     ```sh
     npm install firebase-admin --save
     ```

2. **Initialize the Firebase Admin SDK**:
   - Use the service account JSON file to initialize the SDK:
     ```javascript
     const admin = require('firebase-admin');
     const serviceAccount = require('path/to/serviceAccountKey.json');

     admin.initializeApp({
       credential: admin.credential.cert(serviceAccount)
     });
     ```

3. **Send Notifications Using Firebase Admin SDK**:
   - Here is an example of how to send a notification:
     ```javascript
     const message = {
       notification: {
         title: 'Hello',
         body: 'This is a notification'
       },
       token: 'recipient-device-token'
     };

     admin.messaging().send(message)
       .then(response => {
         console.log('Successfully sent message:', response);
       })
       .catch(error => {
         console.log('Error sending message:', error);
       });
     ```

### Step 4: Update Your Existing Notification Logic

1. **Modify Your Backend Code**:
   - Replace the AWS SNS integration with the direct FCM HTTP v1 API calls using the Firebase Admin SDK.

2. **Handle FCM Tokens**:
   - Ensure your application is correctly handling and storing FCM tokens for users’ devices.

### Step 5: Testing and Validation

1. **Test the Integration**:
   - Thoroughly test the new implementation to ensure notifications are being sent and received correctly.

2. **Monitor and Troubleshoot**:
   - Monitor the logs and metrics to identify any issues and ensure everything is working smoothly.

### Additional Considerations

- **Security**: Ensure your service account JSON file is stored securely and not exposed in your code repository.
- **Scalability**: Consider implementing retry logic and handling rate limits as per FCM guidelines.

By following these steps, you can migrate from the FCM legacy API to the new HTTP v1 API and continue sending notifications to your Android customers using AWS SNS or directly through the Firebase Admin SDK.

The process of updating your AWS SNS integration to use the new Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) API (V1) from the legacy HTTP protocol involves several steps. Here’s a guide to help you transition smoothly:

1. **Obtain the Necessary Credentials from Firebase**:
   - First, you will need to ensure you have the right type of credentials for the FCM v1 API. Unlike the legacy API that used a server key, the FCM v1 API uses a service account key. You can create and download this service account key from the Firebase Console:
     - Go to the Firebase Console.
     - Select your project.
     - Navigate to `Project settings` > `Service accounts`.
     - Click on `Generate new private key` and download the JSON file.

2. **Update AWS SNS Configuration**:
   - Unfortunately, as of the last update, AWS SNS does not directly support the newer HTTP v1 API for Firebase Cloud Messaging; AWS SNS typically requires a server key, which is not used in FCM v1 API.
   - Since AWS SNS hasn't integrated this newer API model yet, you might consider a workaround:
     - **Use AWS Lambda**: You can create an AWS Lambda function that acts as a bridge. This function would take the message from SNS and send it to FCM using the v1 API. Here’s how you can set it up:
       - Write a Lambda function in a language of your choice (like Python or Node.js) that uses the FCM v1 API to send messages.
       - The function should read the SNS message as an input and use the FCM service account credentials to authenticate and send the message.
       - Use the AWS SDK within Lambda to subscribe to the SNS topic and trigger the Lambda function.

3. **Implementing the Lambda Function**:
   - Here's an example of how you might write a Lambda function in Python to send a message via FCM v1:
     ```python
     import json
     import requests
     from google.oauth2 import service_account

     def lambda_handler(event, context):
         # Load your service account credentials
         credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_info(
             json.loads(<YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON>),
             scopes=["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/firebase.messaging"])
         
         # Construct the message
         message = {
             "message": {
                 "token": "<FCM_DEVICE_TOKEN>",
                 "notification": {
                     "title": "Hello",
                     "body": "World"
                 }
             }
         }
         
         # Send the message
         response = requests.post(
             "https://fcm.googleapis.com/v1/projects/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>/messages:send",
             headers={
                 "Authorization": "Bearer " + credentials.token,
                 "Content-Type": "application/json"
             },
             json=message
         )
         return response.json()

     ```
   - Note: Replace `<YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON>`, `<FCM_DEVICE_TOKEN>`, and `<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>` with your actual service account JSON, device token, and project ID.

4. **Testing and Deployment**:
   - Test your Lambda function thoroughly to ensure it correctly handles messages from SNS and communicates effectively with FCM.
   - Once tested, deploy the Lambda function and update the SNS topic subscription to trigger this Lambda function.

This approach leverages AWS Lambda to handle the discrepancy in API requirements between AWS SNS and the latest FCM API. Until AWS updates SNS to support the new FCM API directly, using an intermediary like Lambda will be necessary to bridge the gap.

You're right, server keys are specific to the Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) legacy API. Here's how to migrate your AWS SNS platform integration to the new FCM HTTP v1 API:

**Migration Steps:**
1. **Update Your Mobile App:**
- The most crucial step is updating your mobile app to use the FCM HTTP v1 API for receiving push notifications. Refer to Firebase documentation for the latest integration guidance: https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging

2. **Upgrade Your AWS SNS Platform Application (Optional):**
- While not strictly necessary, you can upgrade your existing AWS SNS platform application to use token-based authentication with the FCM HTTP v1 API. This offers improved security and simplifies management.
- **Method**: In the AWS SNS console, navigate to your existing platform application (created for FCM legacy API). Edit the application and choose "Token-based authentication" under "Authentication method." You won't need a server key here.
- **Benefits**: This upgrade simplifies future updates and leverages token-based authentication for better security.
3. **Continue Sending Push Notifications via AWS SNS:**
- After updating your mobile app and optionally upgrading your platform application, you can continue sending push notifications through AWS SNS as usual. SNS will handle the communication with FCM using the new HTTP v1 API.

**Additional Notes:**

- **FCM Legacy API Deprecation:** The FCM legacy HTTP protocol will be deprecated on June 1st, 2024. Make sure to migrate before then to avoid disruption in your push notification delivery.
- **Security Considerations**: Upgrading to token-based authentication in your platform application is recommended for improved security.

By following these steps, you'll successfully migrate your AWS SNS integration to the new FCM HTTP v1 API and ensure uninterrupted push notification delivery to your Android devices.
