## [Question 7](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74992098/is-aurora-serverless-v1-deprecated)

Is Aurora Serverless V1 deprecated?

Aurora Serverless V1 was particularly interesting given it offered a relational database that could scale down to 0 units thereby costing nothing if unused - great for development and low traffic services.

Aurora Serverless V2 cannot scale down to 0 so it isn't really "serverless" as defined by other AWS serverless products (like Lambda and DynamoDB) and doesn't make it a cost effective replacement for V1 for low traffic websites.

Trying to provision a new Aurora Serverless V1 instance and it's nearly impossible to find an Aurora configuration that offers V1 support.

Is Aurora Serverless V1 deprecated/end of life?

Is there a practical alternative for a "serverless" relational DB where you pay for the storage and seconds of compute that you use?

End of Life email from AWS:

>We are reaching out to let you know that as of December 31, 2024, Amazon Aurora will no longer support Serverless version 1 (v1). As per the Aurora Version Policy [1], we are providing 12 months notice to give you time to upgrade your database cluster(s). Aurora supports two versions of Serverless. We are only announcing the end of support for Serverless v1. Aurora Serverless v2 continues to be supported. We recommend that you proactively upgrade your databases running Amazon Aurora Serverless v1 to Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 at your convenience before December 31, 2024.

Aurora Serverless V1 is not deprecated and is still widely available. However, while it can scale to zero it lacks a lot of the features that Serverless V2 has to offer and I expect to see that gap widen over time as new features get added to V2.

_If your application can run on MySQL 8.0 or PostgreSQL 13, we recommend that you use Aurora Serverless v2. Aurora Serverless v2 scales more quickly and in a more granular way. Aurora Serverless v2 also has more compatibility with other Aurora features such as reader DB instances._

As of the latest information, Amazon Aurora Serverless v1 has not been officially deprecated or marked end-of-life by AWS, but AWS strongly promotes Aurora Serverless v2 due to its enhanced capabilities and performance improvements. However, Aurora Serverless v2 not being able to scale down to zero may indeed affect cost-effectiveness for certain use cases, particularly those involving very low or sporadic traffic.

Here are some suggestions and alternatives to address the issue:

### 1. Check Availability of Aurora Serverless v1
- **AWS Console and Regions:** Ensure that you're checking all available AWS regions. Aurora Serverless v1 might be available in some regions where it is not in others.
- **AWS CLI or SDK:** Sometimes using the AWS CLI or SDK can provide more detailed options for creating Aurora Serverless v1 instances.

### 2. Aurora Serverless v2 with Cost Management
- **Use Auto-Pause:** While Aurora Serverless v2 cannot scale to zero, it supports auto-pause functionality that pauses the database after a period of inactivity, reducing costs. However, note that there will still be a minimum cost.
- **Right-Sizing:** Ensure your Aurora Serverless v2 configuration is right-sized for your workload to avoid unnecessary costs.

### 3. Alternative "Serverless" Database Solutions
- **Amazon RDS Proxy:** Combine RDS with RDS Proxy to manage connections more efficiently, which can help in reducing costs for low-traffic applications.
- **Amazon DynamoDB:** If your application can work with a NoSQL database, DynamoDB is a fully serverless option with on-demand scaling and a pay-per-use pricing model.
- **AWS Aurora On-Demand:** For very infrequent use, you might consider using Aurora in a traditional on-demand mode and manually starting/stopping the instance as needed, though this requires more manual management.

### 4. Third-Party Serverless Databases
- **Google Cloud SQL:** Google Cloud offers a serverless configuration for its Cloud SQL, which might be worth exploring if cross-cloud solutions are an option.
- **Azure SQL Database Serverless:** Microsoft Azure provides a truly serverless SQL database option, which can be a good alternative.

### 5. Contact AWS Support
- **Support Ticket:** If you are having trouble provisioning Aurora Serverless v1, consider opening a support ticket with AWS. They can provide guidance on availability and possibly help you provision the instance if it's still supported.

By exploring these alternatives and strategies, you should be able to find a solution that fits your needs for a cost-effective, serverless relational database.


## ChatGPT-4

It seems like the user is facing a challenge with the transition from Aurora Serverless V1 to V2 and is seeking alternatives for a serverless relational database. Here are some suggestions for addressing their concerns:

1. **Check AWS Documentation**: Verify if Aurora Serverless V1 is officially deprecated or nearing end-of-life by referring to AWS documentation or announcements. AWS usually provides migration guides and timelines for such transitions.

2. **Explore Aurora Serverless V2 Features**: While Aurora Serverless V2 might not scale down to zero, it could still offer benefits such as improved performance, scalability, or additional features compared to V1. Evaluate if the features of V2 justify the shift and if it can still meet the user's requirements effectively.

3. **Cost Analysis**: Although Aurora Serverless V2 doesn't scale down to zero, it might still offer cost advantages depending on the workload patterns and usage. Conduct a thorough cost analysis comparing the pricing models of both V1 and V2 to understand the financial implications accurately.

4. **Consider Reserved Capacity**: Aurora Serverless V2 offers the option to reserve capacity, which can help in controlling costs for predictable workloads. Evaluate if reserving capacity aligns with the user's usage patterns and budget constraints.

5. **Alternative Serverless Databases**: Explore alternative serverless database options provided by AWS or other cloud providers. For example, AWS offers Amazon DynamoDB, a fully managed NoSQL database with serverless capabilities, suitable for workloads with unpredictable traffic.

6. **Evaluate Non-Serverless Options**: If the user's workload doesn't require the serverless model strictly, they can explore traditional Aurora provisioned instances or other managed database services like Amazon RDS, which offer more control over capacity provisioning and might be cost-effective for consistent workloads.

7. **Community Forums and Support**: Engage with the AWS community forums or AWS support for insights and guidance specific to the user's scenario. Other users might have encountered similar challenges and could provide valuable advice or workarounds.

By considering these suggestions, the user can make an informed decision regarding their database solution, whether it involves migrating to Aurora Serverless V2, exploring alternative serverless databases, or opting for non-serverless options based on their specific requirements and constraints.

You're right, V2 incurs costs even during idle periods. This can be less cost-effective for low-traffic applications compared to V1.expand_more
Practical Alternatives for "Serverless" Relational Database:
While there's no perfect replacement for Aurora Serverless V1 with its zero-compute scaling, here are some options to consider:
Aurora Serverless V2 with Auto Scaling:


Utilize Aurora Serverless V2 with auto scaling.expand_more Configure it to automatically scale down to a minimum number of Aurora Capacity Units (ACUs) during low traffic periods to minimize costs. This won't reach zero compute capacity like V1, but it can optimize costs.
RDS with Provisioned Throughput:


Consider using Amazon RDS with provisioned throughput billing. This allows you to pay for a fixed level of database capacity, which can be cost-effective for predictable workloads.
Amazon DynamoDB:


If your application primarily requires non-relational data storage with high scalability and low latency, explore Amazon DynamoDB. It offers a serverless NoSQL database with pay-per-use billing for reads and writes.exclamation
Choosing the Right Option:
The best alternative depends on your specific needs:
Cost Sensitivity: If cost is the primary concern, explore RDS with provisioned throughput or DynamoDB for your use case.
