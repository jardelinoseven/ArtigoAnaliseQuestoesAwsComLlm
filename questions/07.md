## [Question 7 (Feb 20, 2024)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78025461/is-it-possible-to-use-google-cloud-cdn-to-serve-an-s3-bucket-on-aws)

Is it possible to use Google Cloud CDN to serve an S3 bucket on AWS?

We have surplus credits on Google Cloud and our infrastructure is hosted on AWS. However, our CloudFront usage on AWS is proving to be expensive. As a cost-saving measure, we're considering utilizing Google CDN for serving our AWS S3 bucket. For the proof of concept (POC), we've configured Google Cloud CDN having load balancer (note that the architecture differs as Google Cloud CDN uses load balancing features).

We've also specified the test bucket's S3 object that we intend to serve. However, for some reason, requests to the load balancer IP are being redirected to the official page of AWS S3 services, which is unexpected.

What I Tried?

I have created an origin along with load balancing and a network endpoint for the AWS S3 bucket on google cloud. However, it's not working as expected; hitting the load balancer IP of Google Cloud should point to the AWS S3 endpoint instead of the official AWS S3 page.


## Highest-scored answer 

If you make your S3 bucket public and [act as an HTTP server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/HostingWebsiteOnS3Setup.html) you will have access to your content using an URL like https://[mybucket].s3-website-[region].amazonaws.com/.

I see no reason why you could not use this URL with Google CDN. The load balancer aspect sounds unnecessary though.

AWS will charge you for the egress traffic (ie. content leaving AWS and going to Google). If your cache hit ratio is good it will be marginal.

## Q

While I understand your desire to optimize costs, using Google Cloud CDN to serve content from an AWS S3 bucket is not a recommended or supported configuration. There are several reasons for this:

1. Cross-cloud compatibility: AWS S3 and Google Cloud CDN are designed to work within their respective ecosystems. Attempting to integrate them directly can lead to unexpected behavior, as you've experienced.

2. Authentication and security: S3 buckets use AWS-specific authentication mechanisms. Google Cloud CDN may not be able to properly authenticate and access the S3 bucket contents.

3. Performance: Using a CDN from one cloud provider to serve content from another can introduce additional latency and complexity, potentially negating the benefits of using a CDN.

4. Support and troubleshooting: Managing a cross-cloud setup can be challenging, and you may encounter issues that are difficult to diagnose and resolve.

Instead of trying to use Google Cloud CDN with AWS S3, I recommend exploring cost-optimization strategies within the AWS ecosystem:

1. Review your CloudFront configuration: Ensure you're using optimal caching settings and compression to reduce origin fetches and data transfer.

2. Analyze your usage patterns: Use AWS Cost Explorer to identify potential areas for optimization in your CloudFront and S3 usage.

3. Consider AWS cost-saving options: Look into Reserved Capacity for CloudFront or Savings Plans, which can offer significant discounts for committed usage.

4. Optimize your content: Ensure your videos and other content are properly compressed and use efficient formats to reduce data transfer.

5. Implement intelligent tiering in S3: This can automatically move objects between storage classes based on usage patterns, potentially reducing storage costs.

If you're still concerned about costs, I recommend reaching out to AWS Support or your account manager to discuss your specific use case and explore additional cost-optimization strategies within the AWS platform. They can provide tailored advice based on your usage patterns and requirements.

Remember, while it's important to manage costs, it's equally crucial to maintain a secure and efficient architecture. Staying within the AWS ecosystem for your S3 and CDN needs will likely provide the best performance, security, and ease of management for your infrastructure.
