AWS lambda throwing import error because of URLLIB

Im running a python script on aws lambda and its throwing the following error.

```
 {
   "errorMessage": "Unable to import module 'app': urllib3 v2.0 only supports OpenSSL 1.1.1+, currently the 'ssl' module is compiled with OpenSSL 1.0.2k-fips  26 Jan 2017. See: https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2168",
   "errorType": "Runtime.ImportModuleError",
   "stackTrace": [] }
```

It was running perfectly an hour ago , and even after I have made no deployments , it seems to be failing.

my python version is 3.7. and Im only using urllib to parse and unquote urls . namely

`from urllib.parse import urlparse`

and

`from urllib.parse import unquote`

## Highest-scored answer 

specifying my urllib3 to 1.26.15 in the requirement.txt file based on this https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2168#issuecomment-1535838106 thread fixed this error.

The error message indicates that `urllib3` version 2.0+ requires OpenSSL 1.1.1+, but your Lambda environment is using OpenSSL 1.0.2k-fips. This issue can be resolved in several ways:

1. **Pin `urllib3` to a Compatible Version**:
   Since `urllib3` version 2.0+ requires OpenSSL 1.1.1+, you can pin `urllib3` to a version below 2.0 that still supports OpenSSL 1.0.2k. For instance, version 1.26.15.

2. **Use Alternative Libraries**:
   If you prefer not to rely on `urllib`, you can use other libraries that provide similar functionality. However, in this case, since you are using basic URL parsing functions from `urllib.parse`, sticking with `urllib` should be fine if you pin the version correctly.

### Solution 1: Pin `urllib3` to a Compatible Version

1. **Update Your Requirements File**:
   If you are using a `requirements.txt` file to manage your dependencies, pin `urllib3` to a compatible version.

   ```
   urllib3<2.0
   ```

2. **Update the Lambda Layer or Deployment Package**:
   Ensure your Lambda layer or deployment package uses the correct version of `urllib3`. Rebuild your deployment package or Lambda layer with the updated `requirements.txt`.

   ```bash
   # Create a new directory for the package
   mkdir package
   cd package

   # Create a requirements.txt file with the pinned version
   echo "urllib3<2.0" > requirements.txt

   # Install dependencies into the package directory
   pip install -r requirements.txt -t .

   # Zip the package
   zip -r ../lambda-package.zip .
   cd ..

   # Add your Lambda function code to the zip file
   zip -g lambda-package.zip app.py
   ```

3. **Deploy the Updated Package**:
   Deploy the updated zip file to your Lambda function.

### Solution 2: Use Alternative Libraries

If you still want to use alternative libraries for URL parsing, here are a couple of options:

#### `furl` Library
`furl` is a small Python library that makes parsing and manipulating URLs easy.

1. **Install `furl`**:
   Add `furl` to your `requirements.txt`.

   ```bash
   pip install furl
   ```

2. **Use `furl` in Your Code**:

   ```python
   from furl import furl

   # Parsing a URL
   parsed_url = furl('https://example.com/path?query=value')
   print(parsed_url.host)  # example.com
   print(parsed_url.path)  # /path
   print(parsed_url.args)  # {'query': 'value'}

   # Unquote a URL component
   from urllib.parse import unquote
   unquoted_value = unquote('%20')
   print(unquoted_value)  # ' '
   ```

### Summary

- **Pin `urllib3` to a compatible version**: Update your `requirements.txt` to use a version of `urllib3` that supports the OpenSSL version in your Lambda environment.
- **Use an alternative library**: If changing the `urllib3` version is not feasible, you can use an alternative library like `furl` for URL parsing.

By pinning the `urllib3` version to below 2.0, you can ensure compatibility with your current Lambda environment without needing to upgrade OpenSSL or Python versions. This approach should resolve the import error and allow your Lambda function to run successfully.


## ChatGPT-4

The error you are encountering in AWS Lambda is due to the recent update of the `urllib3` library to version 2.0, which only supports OpenSSL version 1.1.1 or higher. However, it appears that the Python environment in your AWS Lambda instance is compiled with an older version of OpenSSL (1.0.2k-fips), which is not compatible with this version of `urllib3`. This situation might be causing intermittent issues if your environments are not consistently updated or synchronized.

Given that upgrading Python could break other dependencies, here are a few alternative solutions that you can consider to resolve the issue without upgrading the entire Python runtime:

### 1. **Pin `urllib3` to an Older Version**
If your code is working in higher environments with the same scripts, it might be because those environments are using an older version of `urllib3` that is compatible with OpenSSL 1.0.2k. You can explicitly pin the version of `urllib3` to a version prior to 2.0 in your Lambda deployment package.

To do this, specify the version in your `requirements.txt` file:

```plaintext
urllib3<2.0
```

Then, rebuild your Lambda deployment package and redeploy. This will ensure that the Lambda environment uses an `urllib3` version that is compatible with the older OpenSSL.

### 2. **Use Different Parts of the Standard Library**
Since you are using `urllib.parse` for parsing and unquoting URLs, and this part of the library does not depend on OpenSSL, you can continue using it without issues. The error message regarding OpenSSL likely pertains to other uses of `urllib3` which may be indirectly included by other packages. Ensure that none of your other dependencies are updating `urllib3` to the incompatible version.

### 3. **Check and Manage Indirect Dependencies**
Sometimes, a different package might be upgrading `urllib3` as part of its dependencies. You can check which package is causing `urllib3` to upgrade by examining the dependency tree. You can use `pipdeptree` tool to do this:

Install pipdeptree:

```bash
pip install pipdeptree
```

Then run it to see the dependency tree:

```bash
pipdeptree
```

Look for which packages depend on `urllib3` and consider pinning those packages to versions that do not require `urllib3` 2.0.

### 4. **Isolate the Problematic Dependency**
If the problem persists and is due to an indirect dependency that you cannot control, consider isolating the problematic dependency in a separate virtual environment or handle its functionality using a different library or method that does not depend on `urllib3`.

### 5. **Contact AWS Support**
If this issue arose suddenly without changes on your side, and if it's impacting your production environments, reaching out to AWS Support for clarification or assistance might also be beneficial. They can provide insights specific to the AWS Lambda environment that your functions are running in.

By using one of these approaches, you should be able to avoid the import error related to `urllib3` and OpenSSL compatibility issues in AWS Lambda.
