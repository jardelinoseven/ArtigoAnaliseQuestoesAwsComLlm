## [Question 4 (Jan 21, 2025)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79375793/s3uploadfailederror-due-to-missingcontentlength-when-calling-putobject-in-mlflow)

S3UploadFailedError due to MissingContentLength when calling PutObject in MLflow using MinIO
When trying to save / upload a file using mlflow.log_artifact() to MinIO, our MLflow users are suddenly getting this error in previously working code, raised in boto3 package (used by the mlflow package, and with S3-compatible local MinIO server acting as a data lake for our local installation of MLflow):

S3UploadFailedError: Failed to upload ./dict-20231204.2.json to mlflow/24/<run_id>/artifacts/dict-20231204.2.json: An error occurred (MissingContentLength) when calling the PutObject operation: You must provide the Content-Length HTTP header.

It is raised here: [..]/python3.11/site-packages/boto3/s3/transfer.py:378, in S3Transfer.upload_file()

Any solutions or at least workarounds to restore file uploads to MinIO buckets?


## Baseline answer 

A quick workaround is to downgrade the S3 client package that raises the error, thus:

$ pip install boto3"<1.36.0"

I have established that the issue (possibly an incompatibility with our legacy MinIO server) has been introduced in version 1.36.0 of boto3 (used by mlflow) and persists in version 1.36.2.


## ChatGPT 4o

The **`S3UploadFailedError: MissingContentLength`** error in MLflow when logging artifacts to **MinIO** using `mlflow.log_artifact()` typically happens due to the **Content-Length header** not being set correctly when using the **S3-compatible API (boto3)**. MinIO enforces the `Content-Length` requirement, whereas AWS S3 can sometimes infer it.

---

## **Possible Solutions**

### **1. Upgrade boto3 and botocore**
A mismatch between boto3, botocore, and MinIO versions may cause this issue. Ensure you are using the latest compatible versions:

```sh
pip install --upgrade boto3 botocore mlflow
```

Then, confirm the versions:
```sh
python -c "import boto3; print(boto3.__version__)"
python -c "import botocore; print(botocore.__version__)"
```
If you are using an older MinIO version, consider upgrading it as well.

---

### **2. Manually Set `Content-Length` in the MLflow Code**
Modify how MLflow interacts with MinIO by explicitly setting the `Content-Length` header when uploading artifacts. 

In your MLflow artifact logging function, try this:
```python
import os
import boto3
import mlflow

s3_client = boto3.client(
    "s3",
    endpoint_url="http://your-minio-server:9000",
    aws_access_key_id="your-access-key",
    aws_secret_access_key="your-secret-key"
)

artifact_path = "./dict-20231204.2.json"
bucket_name = "mlflow"
object_name = f"24/<run_id>/artifacts/{os.path.basename(artifact_path)}"

with open(artifact_path, "rb") as f:
    file_content = f.read()
    s3_client.put_object(
        Bucket=bucket_name,
        Key=object_name,
        Body=file_content,
        ContentLength=len(file_content)  # Explicitly setting Content-Length
    )

mlflow.log_artifact(artifact_path)
```

📌 **Pro:** Ensures `Content-Length` is set, preventing MinIO from rejecting the request.

📌 **Con:** Requires modifying MLflow’s behavior manually.

---

### **3. Use the `MULTIPART_THRESHOLD` Config to Force Chunked Uploads**
Boto3 automatically determines when to use multipart uploads based on file size. Manually **lowering the multipart threshold** can help:

#### **Option A: Set via Environment Variable**
```sh
export AWS_S3_MULTIPART_THRESHOLD=5000000  # 5MB
```

#### **Option B: Configure Boto3 Transfer Settings**
Modify how MLflow interacts with MinIO by adjusting the **multipart transfer settings**:
```python
from boto3.s3.transfer import TransferConfig

config = TransferConfig(multipart_threshold=5 * 1024 * 1024)  # Set threshold to 5MB

s3_client.upload_file(
    artifact_path,
    bucket_name,
    object_name,
    Config=config
)
```

📌 **Pro:** Ensures large files are handled via **multipart uploads**, avoiding `Content-Length` issues.

📌 **Con:** If the file is very small, the issue may still persist.

---

### **4. Verify `mlflow.set_tracking_uri()` Configuration**
Ensure MLflow is correctly configured to work with MinIO:

```python
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("s3://mlflow@http://your-minio-server:9000")
```
Alternatively, try setting the correct **storage backend** explicitly:

```sh
export MLFLOW_S3_ENDPOINT_URL="http://your-minio-server:9000"
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
```

---

### **5. Check MinIO Configuration**
In some cases, **MinIO enforces stricter S3 API compliance** after an upgrade. You can try adjusting MinIO settings:

- Ensure **MinIO’s server-side checks** are not blocking uploads.
- If recent **MinIO updates** caused stricter compliance, consider rolling back to a previous version.

---

### **Final Recommendation**
| Solution | Effectiveness | Complexity |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| **Upgrade boto3 and botocore** | ✅ High | 🟢 Low |
| **Manually set `Content-Length` in code** | ✅ High | 🟡 Medium |
| **Adjust multipart threshold in boto3** | ✅ High | 🟡 Medium |
| **Verify MLflow and MinIO configurations** | ✅ Medium | 🟢 Low |
| **Check MinIO settings** | 🟡 Medium | 🔴 High |

If you need an **immediate workaround**, try **Solution 2 (set Content-Length manually)** or **Solution 3 (adjust multipart threshold)**. For a **long-term fix**, upgrading boto3 and ensuring proper MinIO configuration should help.

## Gemini

This "MissingContentLength" error when uploading to MinIO via MLflow and boto3 indicates a problem with how the content length of the uploaded file is being determined or sent in the HTTP request. Here's a breakdown of possible causes and solutions:

**1. MinIO Configuration:**

* **Check MinIO Version:**
    * Older MinIO versions might have had bugs related to handling `Content-Length`. Ensure you're running a relatively recent, stable version. Update MinIO if necessary.
* **MinIO Server Settings:**
    * Verify that there are no unusual or restrictive configurations on your MinIO server that could be interfering with header processing.
    * Check your MinIO server logs for any related error messages that might provide further clues.
* **Proxy Issues:**
    * If you're using a proxy server between your application and MinIO, the proxy could be stripping or modifying the `Content-Length` header. Test uploading directly to MinIO without the proxy if possible.

**2. MLflow and Boto3 Configuration:**

* **Boto3 Version:**
    * Ensure you are using a compatible and up-to-date version of boto3. Older versions might have bugs or compatibility issues. Try upgrading boto3:
        ```bash
        pip install --upgrade boto3
        ```
* **MLflow Version:**
    * Similarly, ensure your MLflow version is up-to-date.
        ```bash
        pip install --upgrade mlflow
        ```
* **MLflow Artifact Storage Configuration:**
    * Double-check your MLflow configuration for the artifact storage location. Make sure the S3-compatible endpoint is correctly configured to point to your MinIO server.
    * Make very sure that the credentials used by MLflow to connect to MinIO are valid.
* **Explicit Content-Length (Workaround):**
    * While boto3 should handle this automatically, you could try explicitly setting the `Content-Length` header in your upload request as a temporary workaround. However, this is not a proper solution.
    * If you wanted to try this, it would require digging into the boto3 s3 client, and how MLflow is utilizing it, and modifying the upload call. This is not recommended for most users.
* **File Size and Type:**
    * Although unlikely, very large files or specific file types might trigger this error in some edge cases. Test with smaller, simple files (e.g., a small text file) to isolate the issue.

**3. Application Code:**

* **File Handling:**
    * Ensure that the file being uploaded is properly opened and read by your application. Problems with file handles or buffering could potentially lead to incorrect content length calculations.
    * Check that the file actually exists, and that the python process has the correct permissions to read it.
* **MLflow Usage:**
    * Review your MLflow code to ensure that `mlflow.log_artifact()` is being used correctly.
    * Test with a very simple mlflow test script, that just saves a very small file. This will help determine if the problem is with the mlflow setup, or with the users specific code.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1.  **Simplify:** Start with a minimal MLflow script that logs a very small, simple file. This helps isolate whether the problem is with your specific code or the overall setup.
2.  **Isolate:** Try uploading the same file directly to MinIO using the `mc` command-line tool (MinIO client) or another S3-compatible client. This will confirm whether the issue is with MinIO or your application/boto3.
3.  **Logs:** Examine the logs from both your application and the MinIO server for any error messages or warnings.
4.  **Network:** Verify that there are no network connectivity issues between your application and the MinIO server.
5.  **Environment Variables:** Verify that the AWS related environment variables are set correctly. Such as `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL`.

**Example `mc` command:**

```bash
mc cp ./dict-20231204.2.json myminio/mlflow/24/<run_id>/artifacts/dict-20231204.2.json
```

(Replace `myminio` with your MinIO alias.)

By systematically checking these areas, you should be able to pinpoint the root cause of the "MissingContentLength" error and restore your MLflow artifact uploads to MinIO.



## Q

## DeepSeek R1

Here are the recommended solutions to resolve the **`S3UploadFailedError: MissingContentLength`** when uploading artifacts to MinIO via MLflow:

---

### **1. Upgrade `boto3` and `mlflow` to Latest Versions**
Ensure compatibility by updating libraries:
```bash
pip install --upgrade boto3 mlflow
```

---

### **2. Explicitly Set `Content-Length` in Boto3**
Override MLflow’s default S3 client to force `Content-Length` header:
```python
import boto3
from mlflow.store.artifact.s3_artifact_repo import S3ArtifactRepository
from mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient

# Patch boto3 client to enforce Content-Length
class FixedS3ArtifactRepo(S3ArtifactRepository):
    def _upload_file(self, local_file, bucket, key):
        extra_args = {}
        if self.aws_creds.s3_endpoint_url:
            extra_args["endpoint_url"] = self.aws_creds.s3_endpoint_url
        content_length = os.path.getsize(local_file)  # Calculate file size
        with open(local_file, 'rb') as f:
            self.s3_client.upload_fileobj(
                f, bucket, key,
                ExtraArgs={'ContentLength': content_length, **extra_args}
            )

# Override MLflow's S3 client
MlflowClient().artifact_repository = FixedS3ArtifactRepo("s3://mlflow/artifacts")
```

---

### **3. Configure MinIO to Tolerate Missing Headers (Temporary Fix)**
**Note:** Only use this if you control the MinIO server and understand the risks.  
Start MinIO with relaxed header checks:
```bash
minio server /data --compat
```

---

### **4. Set AWS SDK Environment Variables**
Force boto3 to use the correct S3 API behavior:
```python
import os
os.environ["AWS_EC2_METADATA_DISABLED"] = "TRUE"  # Disable EC2 metadata checks
os.environ["AWS_S3_ADDRESSING_STYLE"] = "path"    # Use path-style URLs
```

---

### **5. Verify File Handling in MLflow**
Ensure files are closed and accessible before logging:
```python
import mlflow

with open("./dict-20231204.2.json", "w") as f:
    # Write data to file
    ...

mlflow.log_artifact("./dict-20231204.2.json")  # Use file path, not open file object
```

---

### **6. Downgrade Boto3 (If Recent Update Broke Compatibility)**
Test with older versions (e.g., `boto3==1.28.63`):
```bash
pip install boto3==1.28.63
```

---

### **7. Directly Use MinIO Python SDK**
Bypass MLflow’s artifact logging temporarily:
```python
from minio import Minio
from minio.error import S3Error

client = Minio(
    "minio.example.com",
    access_key="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY",
    secret_key="YOUR_SECRET_KEY",
    secure=False
)

try:
    client.fput_object(
        "mlflow", "24/<run_id>/artifacts/dict-20231204.2.json",
        "./dict-20231204.2.json",
        metadata={"Content-Length": str(os.path.getsize("./dict-20231204.2.json"))}
    )
except S3Error as e:
    print("Error:", e)
```

---

### **Why This Happens**
- **MinIO Strict Compliance:** MinIO enforces S3 API standards more rigorously than AWS S3. Missing `Content-Length` headers are rejected.
- **Boto3/MLflow Behavior:** Some versions of `boto3` or `mlflow` may omit headers when streaming files or using file-like objects.

---

### **Final Recommendation**
- **Primary Fix:** Use the **explicit `Content-Length` patch** (Step 2) to resolve the issue immediately.
- **Long-Term:** Ensure `boto3` and `mlflow` are kept up-to-date with MinIO’s requirements.

## ChatGPT-o1

Here are some approaches that often resolve the “MissingContentLength” error when uploading to MinIO via MLflow (i.e., using boto3 and S3-compatible APIs):

---

## 1. Disable Chunked Encoding (force sending a Content-Length header)
By default, boto3 may use chunked transfer encoding, which MinIO can sometimes reject if it requires a Content-Length. One typical fix is to disable chunked encoding on uploads so that boto3 includes a Content-Length header directly.

- **At the application code level**: If you have direct control over the S3 client creation, you can set:
  ```python
  s3 = boto3.client(
      's3',
      use_ssl=False,
      config=Config(s3={'use_accelerate_endpoint': False, 'addressing_style': 'path'}, signature_version='s3v4', **{
          # The important part:
          'use_dualstack_endpoint': False,
          's3': {
              'payload_signing_enabled': True,    # or set if needed
              'use_accelerate_endpoint': False,
              'use_fips_endpoint': False,
              'use_arn_region': False
          }
      })
  )
  ```
  However, the chunked encoding flag is actually a bit hidden. An alternative approach is a session variable or environment variable override (see below).

- **Via environment variable**:  
  Boto3 respects certain environment variables for chunking, e.g., setting `AWS_S3_DISABLE_MULTIPART` or `S3_DISABLE_MULTIPART_UPLOAD` to `true` can help. In many setups, you can do:
  ```bash
  export AWS_S3_DISABLE_MULTIPART=1
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  export S3_DISABLE_MULTIPART_UPLOAD=1
  ```
  Then retest your MLflow artifact logging. This will cause large file uploads to be done in a single PUT with a known Content-Length.

- **Check MLflow docs**:  
  There isn’t a built-in MLflow config key *specifically* for toggling chunked encoding, but MLflow does respect underlying boto3 environment variables. Confirm you have the environment variable set in whichever shell or process is actually launching your MLflow code.

---

## 2. Pin / Change Versions (boto3, MLflow, MinIO)
Sometimes a mismatch between your local MinIO version and a newer boto3 or MLflow release triggers the “MissingContentLength” problem. Trying these steps can help:

1. **Upgrade MinIO** to a later release – older MinIO servers often had stricter or missing support for chunked encoding.  
2. **Pin your boto3 version** to a known working release. E.g., if your environment recently upgraded to boto3 1.26.x or 1.28.x, rolling back to a version that previously worked may temporarily fix the error.  
3. **Check MLflow version** – if you updated MLflow recently, it may have changed how it calls boto3.

---

## 3. Switch to a Static / Known File Path
If for some reason MLflow is streaming your artifact in a way that hides file length, you can ensure that `mlflow.log_artifact(...)` sees a normal file on disk with a known length:

```python
# Instead of building a bytes buffer in memory, ensure you have a real file:
local_path = "dict-20231204.2.json"
with open(local_path, "w") as f:
    json.dump(my_dict, f)

mlflow.log_artifact(local_path, artifact_path="...")
```

Typically, MLflow will pass the local file path to boto3’s upload mechanism, which can easily detect the file size. This might get around the MissingContentLength error if the prior approach was an in-memory stream.

---

## 4. Manually Force Content-Length in Extra Args
Although less common, you might try hooking into MLflow’s internal S3 upload calls with “extra_args” that explicitly supply `ContentLength`. However, MLflow’s out-of-the-box `log_artifact()` function does not directly expose a parameter for that. If you’re customizing MLflow or hooking into the underlying `boto3.client('s3').upload_fileobj(...)`, you can do something like:

```python
s3.upload_file(
   Filename='dict-20231204.2.json',
   Bucket='mlflow',
   Key='24/<run_id>/artifacts/dict-20231204.2.json',
   ExtraArgs={'ContentLength': os.path.getsize('dict-20231204.2.json')}
)
```

But in a typical MLflow environment, you don’t always have direct control. Usually disabling chunked encoding or ensuring the file has a known size is simpler.

---

## 5. Use a Different Artifact Storage Option Temporarily
If none of the above is easily implemented in your environment, you can at least reconfigure MLflow to store artifacts in a local file store or on a different, fully S3-compliant endpoint until you have a chance to address the content-length issue. This at least unblocks your MLflow experiments while you debug.

---

### Summary
- **Disable chunked encoding** (via environment variables or config) so MinIO sees a Content-Length header.  
- **Upgrade / pin** versions of MinIO, MLflow, and boto3. Mismatch can cause abrupt issues.  
- **Ensure** MLflow sees a normal local file path and that the file size is easily determined.  
- **Force** ContentLength or switch to a more modern MinIO version that handles chunked uploads.  

These workarounds typically restore the ability to upload artifacts to your MinIO “S3” bucket from MLflow.


## Analysis

Below is a structured evaluation of each chatbot response compared to the **baseline answer** from Stack Overflow, which emphasizes that the issue arises from a **boto3** version incompatibility (introduced in **v1.36.0**) with an older MinIO server, and that a quick workaround is to **downgrade boto3** (e.g., `pip install boto3"<1.36.0"`).

---

## Baseline Answer (for reference)

> **Baseline Key Points**  
> 1. Error possibly stems from an incompatibility in the newer boto3 version (≥ 1.36.0) with a legacy MinIO server.  
> 2. A simple and immediate **workaround** is:  
>   ```bash
>   pip install boto3"<1.36.0"

>  - Proposes adjusting multipart thresholds, verifying MLflow & MinIO configurations, and possibly checking MinIO settings.  

### 1. Accuracy
- **Comparison to Baseline:**  
  - The baseline’s primary solution is downgrading boto3 (< 1.36.0). Chatbot #1 instead first suggests **upgrading** to the latest version. That may help in some cases if MinIO is also upgraded, but it does not explicitly match the baseline’s mention of a known regression introduced in 1.36.0.  
  - Chatbot #1 does mention other **valid** strategies (setting `Content-Length` manually, checking thresholds, etc.), which are indeed plausible solutions.  
  - **Potential Discrepancy:** It does not highlight that the regression specifically starts at boto3 1.36.0, nor that downgrading is a guaranteed quick fix.  
- **Factual Correctness:**  
  - Overall, the advice is mostly correct in a general sense. However, it conflicts with the baseline approach (downgrading) and might misdirect someone by suggesting an **upgrade** first, which might not work if the MinIO server is older.

> **Rating:** **Partially satisfactory** (it provides correct methods but omits or contradicts the core baseline fix about downgrading and doesn’t emphasize the known version-specific issue).

### 2. Completeness
- Covers multiple angles: upgrading, manually setting headers, configuring multipart uploads, verifying MLflow config, and checking MinIO.  
- **Missing** a direct mention of **downgrading** boto3 to versions prior to 1.36.0 (the baseline solution).  

> **Rating:** **Partially satisfactory** (plenty of solutions, but omits the direct baseline “downgrade” workaround).

### 3. Clarity
- The response is **well-structured**, with clear subheadings. Explains each potential fix step by step.  
- Terminology is explained sufficiently for a technical audience.  

> **Rating:** **Satisfactory**

### 4. Practicality
- Suggests workable solutions (e.g., manual `Content-Length`, adjusting multipart thresholds) that can fix the issue.  
- However, it does not directly highlight the **fastest** or simplest approach (i.e., downgrading below 1.36.0).  

> **Rating:** **Partially satisfactory** (the solutions can work, but the easiest fix—matching the baseline approach—is missing).

### Overall Rating for Response #1
> **Partially satisfactory**  
> It provides a decent variety of approaches but glosses over the simplest baseline fix (downgrading) and doesn’t mention the introduced regression at 1.36.0.

# Chatbot Response #4

> **Summary of Response #4**  
>  - Recommends upgrading `boto3` and `mlflow`, explicitly setting `Content-Length`, running MinIO in `--compat` mode, environment variable adjustments, or downgrading `boto3`.  

### 1. Accuracy
- **Comparison to Baseline:**  
  - This response does actually mention **downgrading boto3** as a final step: “If recent update broke compatibility ….”  
  - That *does* align with the baseline’s quick fix, even if it’s listed after other suggestions.  
- The mention of forcibly setting `Content-Length`, patching MLflow code, or modifying MinIO config are also valid.  

> **Rating:** **Satisfactory** (it captures the baseline’s key fix—downgrading—and provides more solutions).

### 2. Completeness
- Covers multiple approaches, including the baseline solution.  
- Offers additional detail about patching MLflow, changing server-side checks, etc.  

> **Rating:** **Satisfactory** (includes the baseline approach plus additional solutions).

# Chatbot Response #5

> **Summary of Response #5**  
>  - Explains that chunked encoding can cause MinIO to reject uploads if `Content-Length` is missing.  
>  - Mentions environment variables to disable multipart, version mismatch.  
>  - Suggests either upgrading/downgrading or forcibly specifying `ContentLength`.  

### 1. Accuracy
- **Comparison to Baseline:**  
  - It discusses both the possibility of **disabling chunked encoding** and potentially **pinning or changing versions** (including downgrading).  
  - It notes: “Trying these steps can help … pin your boto3 version to a known working release.” Although it doesn’t explicitly say `1.36.0`, it strongly implies you should revert if the new version broke things.  
- This is pretty consistent with the baseline’s reasoning (that the new version introduced issues).  

> **Rating:** **Satisfactory**

### 2. Completeness
- Provides different angles: disabling chunked encoding, forcibly setting `ContentLength`, verifying file paths, and rolling back versions.  
- Though it doesn’t mention exactly “downgrade to <1.36.0,” it does say “Pin your boto3 version … rolling back.”  

> **Rating:** **Satisfactory** (it covers the core approach and multiple solutions).

### 3. Clarity
- Sections are well-titled, and the steps are explained concisely.  
- Clear references to environment variables and typical config changes.  

> **Rating:** **Satisfactory**

### 4. Practicality
- Provides immediate environment-based fixes (like disabling chunked encoding) and also references version pinning.  
- Very actionable for real-world scenarios.  

> **Rating:** **Satisfactory**

### Overall Rating for Response #5
> **Satisfactory**  
> It’s coherent, references downgrading or pinning versions, and suggests multiple practical steps.

# Summary of Findings Across All Chatbot Responses

## Accuracy
- **Chatbot #1 and #2** mostly give valid general S3/MinIO advice but skip or contradict the baseline’s known version conflict and the direct fix via downgrading pre-1.36.0.  
- **Chatbot #3** does not give a solution at all (just asks questions).  
- **Chatbot #4 and #5** specifically mention a version mismatch and the possibility of downgrading or pinning boto3, aligning more closely with the baseline’s root cause and solution.

## Completeness
- **Chatbot #3** is incomplete (no actual solutions).  
- **Chatbot #1 and #2** are broad but omit direct mention of the baseline’s “downgrade <1.36.0.”  
- **Chatbot #4 and #5** are the most complete, referencing multiple solutions **and** the baseline’s direct approach (downgrade / version pinning).

## Clarity
- All except #3 are structured decently. #1, #4, and #5 provide especially clear bullet points or headings. #2 uses lists but is a bit less direct about the immediate fix. #3’s clarity is fine as a request for info, but it doesn’t address the problem.

## Practicality
- **Chatbot #1** and #2** do provide workable steps but omit the simplest fix of downgrading; they may lead to more complicated solutions than necessary.  
- **Chatbot #4 and #5** give multiple immediate and longer-term solutions, including the straightforward approach from the baseline. They are highly practical for real-world troubleshooting.  
- **Chatbot #3** offers no direct fix, so practicality is poor.

---

# Overall Best Response
- **Chatbot #4 and Chatbot #5** are the best because they each **explicitly include** the workaround of downgrading boto3, aligning directly with the baseline solution, and add other useful suggestions. They are strong in all evaluation criteria: accuracy, completeness, clarity, and practicality.

# Overall Worst Response
- **Chatbot #3** is the worst in this context, as it provides no concrete fix or alignment with the baseline solution. It focuses on gathering information rather than solving the problem.

### Final Note
When this error arises specifically due to a **regression introduced in boto3 1.36.0**, the baseline fix of  
```
pip install boto3"<1.36.0"
```
is the fastest and most direct approach. Chatbots #4 and #5 align most closely with that method, while #1 and #2, though offering useful generic S3 debugging tips, do not emphasize that immediate workaround.
