S3UploadFailedError due to MissingContentLength when calling PutObject in MLflow using MinIO
When trying to save / upload a file using mlflow.log_artifact() to MinIO, our MLflow users are suddenly getting this error in previously working code, raised in boto3 package (used by the mlflow package, and with S3-compatible local MinIO server acting as a data lake for our local installation of MLflow):

S3UploadFailedError: Failed to upload ./dict-20231204.2.json to mlflow/24/<run_id>/artifacts/dict-20231204.2.json: An error occurred (MissingContentLength) when calling the PutObject operation: You must provide the Content-Length HTTP header.

It is raised here: [..]/python3.11/site-packages/boto3/s3/transfer.py:378, in S3Transfer.upload_file()

Any solutions or at least workarounds to restore file uploads to MinIO buckets?


## Highest-scored answer 

A quick workaround is to downgrade the S3 client package that raises the error, thus:

$ pip install boto3"<1.36.0"

I have established that the issue (possibly an incompatibility with our legacy MinIO server) has been introduced in version 1.36.0 of boto3 (used by mlflow) and persists in version 1.36.2.


## ChatGPT 4o

The **`S3UploadFailedError: MissingContentLength`** error in MLflow when logging artifacts to **MinIO** using `mlflow.log_artifact()` typically happens due to the **Content-Length header** not being set correctly when using the **S3-compatible API (boto3)**. MinIO enforces the `Content-Length` requirement, whereas AWS S3 can sometimes infer it.

---

## **Possible Solutions**

### **1. Upgrade boto3 and botocore**
A mismatch between boto3, botocore, and MinIO versions may cause this issue. Ensure you are using the latest compatible versions:

```sh
pip install --upgrade boto3 botocore mlflow
```

Then, confirm the versions:
```sh
python -c "import boto3; print(boto3.__version__)"
python -c "import botocore; print(botocore.__version__)"
```
If you are using an older MinIO version, consider upgrading it as well.

---

### **2. Manually Set `Content-Length` in the MLflow Code**
Modify how MLflow interacts with MinIO by explicitly setting the `Content-Length` header when uploading artifacts. 

In your MLflow artifact logging function, try this:
```python
import os
import boto3
import mlflow

s3_client = boto3.client(
    "s3",
    endpoint_url="http://your-minio-server:9000",
    aws_access_key_id="your-access-key",
    aws_secret_access_key="your-secret-key"
)

artifact_path = "./dict-20231204.2.json"
bucket_name = "mlflow"
object_name = f"24/<run_id>/artifacts/{os.path.basename(artifact_path)}"

with open(artifact_path, "rb") as f:
    file_content = f.read()
    s3_client.put_object(
        Bucket=bucket_name,
        Key=object_name,
        Body=file_content,
        ContentLength=len(file_content)  # Explicitly setting Content-Length
    )

mlflow.log_artifact(artifact_path)
```

üìå **Pro:** Ensures `Content-Length` is set, preventing MinIO from rejecting the request.

üìå **Con:** Requires modifying MLflow‚Äôs behavior manually.

---

### **3. Use the `MULTIPART_THRESHOLD` Config to Force Chunked Uploads**
Boto3 automatically determines when to use multipart uploads based on file size. Manually **lowering the multipart threshold** can help:

#### **Option A: Set via Environment Variable**
```sh
export AWS_S3_MULTIPART_THRESHOLD=5000000  # 5MB
```

#### **Option B: Configure Boto3 Transfer Settings**
Modify how MLflow interacts with MinIO by adjusting the **multipart transfer settings**:
```python
from boto3.s3.transfer import TransferConfig

config = TransferConfig(multipart_threshold=5 * 1024 * 1024)  # Set threshold to 5MB

s3_client.upload_file(
    artifact_path,
    bucket_name,
    object_name,
    Config=config
)
```

üìå **Pro:** Ensures large files are handled via **multipart uploads**, avoiding `Content-Length` issues.

üìå **Con:** If the file is very small, the issue may still persist.

---

### **4. Verify `mlflow.set_tracking_uri()` Configuration**
Ensure MLflow is correctly configured to work with MinIO:

```python
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("s3://mlflow@http://your-minio-server:9000")
```
Alternatively, try setting the correct **storage backend** explicitly:

```sh
export MLFLOW_S3_ENDPOINT_URL="http://your-minio-server:9000"
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
```

---

### **5. Check MinIO Configuration**
In some cases, **MinIO enforces stricter S3 API compliance** after an upgrade. You can try adjusting MinIO settings:

- Ensure **MinIO‚Äôs server-side checks** are not blocking uploads.
- If recent **MinIO updates** caused stricter compliance, consider rolling back to a previous version.

---

### **Final Recommendation**
| Solution | Effectiveness | Complexity |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| **Upgrade boto3 and botocore** | ‚úÖ High | üü¢ Low |
| **Manually set `Content-Length` in code** | ‚úÖ High | üü° Medium |
| **Adjust multipart threshold in boto3** | ‚úÖ High | üü° Medium |
| **Verify MLflow and MinIO configurations** | ‚úÖ Medium | üü¢ Low |
| **Check MinIO settings** | üü° Medium | üî¥ High |

If you need an **immediate workaround**, try **Solution 2 (set Content-Length manually)** or **Solution 3 (adjust multipart threshold)**. For a **long-term fix**, upgrading boto3 and ensuring proper MinIO configuration should help.

## DeepSeek R1

Here are the recommended solutions to resolve the **`S3UploadFailedError: MissingContentLength`** when uploading artifacts to MinIO via MLflow:

---

### **1. Upgrade `boto3` and `mlflow` to Latest Versions**
Ensure compatibility by updating libraries:
```bash
pip install --upgrade boto3 mlflow
```

---

### **2. Explicitly Set `Content-Length` in Boto3**
Override MLflow‚Äôs default S3 client to force `Content-Length` header:
```python
import boto3
from mlflow.store.artifact.s3_artifact_repo import S3ArtifactRepository
from mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient

# Patch boto3 client to enforce Content-Length
class FixedS3ArtifactRepo(S3ArtifactRepository):
    def _upload_file(self, local_file, bucket, key):
        extra_args = {}
        if self.aws_creds.s3_endpoint_url:
            extra_args["endpoint_url"] = self.aws_creds.s3_endpoint_url
        content_length = os.path.getsize(local_file)  # Calculate file size
        with open(local_file, 'rb') as f:
            self.s3_client.upload_fileobj(
                f, bucket, key,
                ExtraArgs={'ContentLength': content_length, **extra_args}
            )

# Override MLflow's S3 client
MlflowClient().artifact_repository = FixedS3ArtifactRepo("s3://mlflow/artifacts")
```

---

### **3. Configure MinIO to Tolerate Missing Headers (Temporary Fix)**
**Note:** Only use this if you control the MinIO server and understand the risks.  
Start MinIO with relaxed header checks:
```bash
minio server /data --compat
```

---

### **4. Set AWS SDK Environment Variables**
Force boto3 to use the correct S3 API behavior:
```python
import os
os.environ["AWS_EC2_METADATA_DISABLED"] = "TRUE"  # Disable EC2 metadata checks
os.environ["AWS_S3_ADDRESSING_STYLE"] = "path"    # Use path-style URLs
```

---

### **5. Verify File Handling in MLflow**
Ensure files are closed and accessible before logging:
```python
import mlflow

with open("./dict-20231204.2.json", "w") as f:
    # Write data to file
    ...

mlflow.log_artifact("./dict-20231204.2.json")  # Use file path, not open file object
```

---

### **6. Downgrade Boto3 (If Recent Update Broke Compatibility)**
Test with older versions (e.g., `boto3==1.28.63`):
```bash
pip install boto3==1.28.63
```

---

### **7. Directly Use MinIO Python SDK**
Bypass MLflow‚Äôs artifact logging temporarily:
```python
from minio import Minio
from minio.error import S3Error

client = Minio(
    "minio.example.com",
    access_key="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY",
    secret_key="YOUR_SECRET_KEY",
    secure=False
)

try:
    client.fput_object(
        "mlflow", "24/<run_id>/artifacts/dict-20231204.2.json",
        "./dict-20231204.2.json",
        metadata={"Content-Length": str(os.path.getsize("./dict-20231204.2.json"))}
    )
except S3Error as e:
    print("Error:", e)
```

---

### **Why This Happens**
- **MinIO Strict Compliance:** MinIO enforces S3 API standards more rigorously than AWS S3. Missing `Content-Length` headers are rejected.
- **Boto3/MLflow Behavior:** Some versions of `boto3` or `mlflow` may omit headers when streaming files or using file-like objects.

---

### **Final Recommendation**
- **Primary Fix:** Use the **explicit `Content-Length` patch** (Step 2) to resolve the issue immediately.
- **Long-Term:** Ensure `boto3` and `mlflow` are kept up-to-date with MinIO‚Äôs requirements.

## ChatGPT-o1

Here are some approaches that often resolve the ‚ÄúMissingContentLength‚Äù error when uploading to MinIO via MLflow (i.e., using boto3 and S3-compatible APIs):

---

## 1. Disable Chunked Encoding (force sending a Content-Length header)
By default, boto3 may use chunked transfer encoding, which MinIO can sometimes reject if it requires a Content-Length. One typical fix is to disable chunked encoding on uploads so that boto3 includes a Content-Length header directly.

- **At the application code level**: If you have direct control over the S3 client creation, you can set:
  ```python
  s3 = boto3.client(
      's3',
      use_ssl=False,
      config=Config(s3={'use_accelerate_endpoint': False, 'addressing_style': 'path'}, signature_version='s3v4', **{
          # The important part:
          'use_dualstack_endpoint': False,
          's3': {
              'payload_signing_enabled': True,    # or set if needed
              'use_accelerate_endpoint': False,
              'use_fips_endpoint': False,
              'use_arn_region': False
          }
      })
  )
  ```
  However, the chunked encoding flag is actually a bit hidden. An alternative approach is a session variable or environment variable override (see below).

- **Via environment variable**:  
  Boto3 respects certain environment variables for chunking, e.g., setting `AWS_S3_DISABLE_MULTIPART` or `S3_DISABLE_MULTIPART_UPLOAD` to `true` can help. In many setups, you can do:
  ```bash
  export AWS_S3_DISABLE_MULTIPART=1
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  export S3_DISABLE_MULTIPART_UPLOAD=1
  ```
  Then retest your MLflow artifact logging. This will cause large file uploads to be done in a single PUT with a known Content-Length.

- **Check MLflow docs**:  
  There isn‚Äôt a built-in MLflow config key *specifically* for toggling chunked encoding, but MLflow does respect underlying boto3 environment variables. Confirm you have the environment variable set in whichever shell or process is actually launching your MLflow code.

---

## 2. Pin / Change Versions (boto3, MLflow, MinIO)
Sometimes a mismatch between your local MinIO version and a newer boto3 or MLflow release triggers the ‚ÄúMissingContentLength‚Äù problem. Trying these steps can help:

1. **Upgrade MinIO** to a later release ‚Äì older MinIO servers often had stricter or missing support for chunked encoding.  
2. **Pin your boto3 version** to a known working release. E.g., if your environment recently upgraded to boto3 1.26.x or 1.28.x, rolling back to a version that previously worked may temporarily fix the error.  
3. **Check MLflow version** ‚Äì if you updated MLflow recently, it may have changed how it calls boto3.

---

## 3. Switch to a Static / Known File Path
If for some reason MLflow is streaming your artifact in a way that hides file length, you can ensure that `mlflow.log_artifact(...)` sees a normal file on disk with a known length:

```python
# Instead of building a bytes buffer in memory, ensure you have a real file:
local_path = "dict-20231204.2.json"
with open(local_path, "w") as f:
    json.dump(my_dict, f)

mlflow.log_artifact(local_path, artifact_path="...")
```

Typically, MLflow will pass the local file path to boto3‚Äôs upload mechanism, which can easily detect the file size. This might get around the MissingContentLength error if the prior approach was an in-memory stream.

---

## 4. Manually Force Content-Length in Extra Args
Although less common, you might try hooking into MLflow‚Äôs internal S3 upload calls with ‚Äúextra_args‚Äù that explicitly supply `ContentLength`. However, MLflow‚Äôs out-of-the-box `log_artifact()` function does not directly expose a parameter for that. If you‚Äôre customizing MLflow or hooking into the underlying `boto3.client('s3').upload_fileobj(...)`, you can do something like:

```python
s3.upload_file(
   Filename='dict-20231204.2.json',
   Bucket='mlflow',
   Key='24/<run_id>/artifacts/dict-20231204.2.json',
   ExtraArgs={'ContentLength': os.path.getsize('dict-20231204.2.json')}
)
```

But in a typical MLflow environment, you don‚Äôt always have direct control. Usually disabling chunked encoding or ensuring the file has a known size is simpler.

---

## 5. Use a Different Artifact Storage Option Temporarily
If none of the above is easily implemented in your environment, you can at least reconfigure MLflow to store artifacts in a local file store or on a different, fully S3-compliant endpoint until you have a chance to address the content-length issue. This at least unblocks your MLflow experiments while you debug.

---

### Summary
- **Disable chunked encoding** (via environment variables or config) so MinIO sees a Content-Length header.  
- **Upgrade / pin** versions of MinIO, MLflow, and boto3. Mismatch can cause abrupt issues.  
- **Ensure** MLflow sees a normal local file path and that the file size is easily determined.  
- **Force** ContentLength or switch to a more modern MinIO version that handles chunked uploads.  

These workarounds typically restore the ability to upload artifacts to your MinIO ‚ÄúS3‚Äù bucket from MLflow.
