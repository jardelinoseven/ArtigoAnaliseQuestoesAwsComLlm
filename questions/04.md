S3UploadFailedError due to MissingContentLength when calling PutObject in MLflow using MinIO
When trying to save / upload a file using mlflow.log_artifact() to MinIO, our MLflow users are suddenly getting this error in previously working code, raised in boto3 package (used by the mlflow package, and with S3-compatible local MinIO server acting as a data lake for our local installation of MLflow):

S3UploadFailedError: Failed to upload ./dict-20231204.2.json to mlflow/24/<run_id>/artifacts/dict-20231204.2.json: An error occurred (MissingContentLength) when calling the PutObject operation: You must provide the Content-Length HTTP header.

It is raised here: [..]/python3.11/site-packages/boto3/s3/transfer.py:378, in S3Transfer.upload_file()

Any solutions or at least workarounds to restore file uploads to MinIO buckets?


## Highest-scored answer 

A quick workaround is to downgrade the S3 client package that raises the error, thus:

$ pip install boto3"<1.36.0"

I have established that the issue (possibly an incompatibility with our legacy MinIO server) has been introduced in version 1.36.0 of boto3 (used by mlflow) and persists in version 1.36.2.

## Q

To help troubleshoot this S3 upload issue with MinIO, I need some additional information:

1. When did this issue start occurring? Was there any recent change in your environment or dependencies?
2. What versions of MLflow, boto3, and MinIO are you using?
3. Can you provide the AWS Region where your MinIO server is located?
4. Are you able to upload files directly to MinIO using the AWS CLI or boto3, without involving MLflow?
5. Have you checked if there are any recent updates or known issues with MLflow or MinIO that might be related to this problem?

Please provide as much information as you can. If you're unsure about any of these details, just let me know, and we can proceed with troubleshooting based on the information available.
