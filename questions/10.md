## [Question 10 (Jan 2, 2024)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77744589/struggling-to-fix-referenceerror-property-readablestream-doesnt-exist)

struggling to fix: "ReferenceError: Property 'ReadableStream' doesn't exist"

I am working on a project with AWS-SDK V3, Cognito and AWS. I am struggling to setup basic functions, and keep getting errors like: ReferenceError: Property 'ReadableStream' doesn't exist. I can't find anything online, and I am questioning if this is even a good authentication approach for a scalable react native application. Has anyone dealt with this issue or know how to fix it? I am simply trying to use an "initiateauthcommand" from the V3 library, but clearly there are some compatability issues.

For context, I am using an EXPO development environment for my react native ios mobile app.

I tried using metro bundler fixes, doing pollyfilling, none of it worked. I am stumped.


## Highest-scored answer 

Ensure you've added the required polyfills for ReadableStream in your React Native Expo project. Try these imports:

import 'react-native-get-random-values';
import 'react-native-url-polyfill/auto';
import { ReadableStream } from 'web-streams-polyfill/ponyfill';
globalThis.ReadableStream = ReadableStream;

Install necessary packages:

npm install react-native-get-random-values react-native-url-polyfill web-streams-polyfill

If the issue persists, check for library updates and ensure compatibility with React Native. Consider exploring other authentication options based on your project needs.

### **Fixing "ReferenceError: Property 'ReadableStream' doesn't exist" in AWS SDK V3 for React Native (Expo)**

This error occurs because **React Native (especially in an Expo environment) does not support `ReadableStream` natively**. AWS SDK v3 relies on **Web Streams API**, which is available in browsers and Node.js, but **not in React Native** by default.

---

## **Solution 1: Install a Polyfill for ReadableStream**
Since **React Native does not have built-in support for `ReadableStream`**, the easiest fix is to polyfill it.

### **Steps:**
1. Install `react-native-polyfill-globals`:
   ```sh
   npm install react-native-polyfill-globals
   ```
   
2. Import the polyfill at the top of your **index.js** or **App.js**:
   ```js
   import "react-native-polyfill-globals/auto";
   ```

✅ **Why this works?**  
This package adds missing **global browser APIs**, including `ReadableStream`, making AWS SDK v3 compatible with React Native.

---

## **Solution 2: Use an Alternative Polyfill (`web-streams-polyfill`)**
If `react-native-polyfill-globals` doesn’t work, manually polyfill `ReadableStream`.

### **Steps:**
1. Install `web-streams-polyfill`:
   ```sh
   npm install web-streams-polyfill
   ```

2. Add this to your `index.js` or `App.js`:
   ```js
   import { ReadableStream } from "web-streams-polyfill/ponyfill";
   global.ReadableStream = global.ReadableStream || ReadableStream;
   ```

✅ **Why this works?**  
This explicitly defines `ReadableStream` globally, preventing the AWS SDK from failing.

---

## **Solution 3: Downgrade to AWS SDK V2**
AWS SDK v3 was designed for browsers and Node.js, making it **less compatible** with React Native. If you **don’t need AWS SDK v3 features**, **downgrading to AWS SDK v2** is a simple fix.

### **Steps:**
1. Uninstall AWS SDK v3:
   ```sh
   npm uninstall @aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity-provider
   ```

2. Install AWS SDK v2:
   ```sh
   npm install aws-sdk
   ```

3. Update your imports:
   ```js
   import AWS from "aws-sdk";
   ```

✅ **Why this works?**  
AWS SDK v2 was **natively supported in React Native**, while v3 requires extra compatibility layers.

---

## **Solution 4: Modify Metro Bundler Config**
React Native’s **Metro Bundler** may strip out necessary polyfills. Adding a custom configuration can help.

### **Steps:**
1. Edit `metro.config.js`:
   ```js
   const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");

   module.exports = {
     resolver: {
       extraNodeModules: {
         stream: require.resolve("stream-browserify"),
       },
     },
   };
   ```

2. Install `stream-browserify`:
   ```sh
   npm install stream-browserify
   ```

✅ **Why this works?**  
Ensures Metro Bundler includes missing `stream` dependencies required by AWS SDK v3.

---

## **Best Approach for a Scalable React Native App**
If you’re questioning whether **AWS SDK v3 + Cognito** is the best choice for **scalable authentication in React Native**, consider these options:

- **Use AWS Amplify instead**:  
  - Easier Cognito integration.
  - Works well with React Native.
  - Automatically manages authentication.

  ```sh
  npm install aws-amplify
  ```

  Then, configure authentication:
  ```js
  import Amplify from "aws-amplify";
  import awsconfig from "./aws-exports";
  Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
  ```

- **Use Firebase Authentication** (if not tied to Cognito):  
  - Faster setup.
  - No need for AWS SDK workarounds.

---

## **Final Recommendation**
| **Solution** | **Effectiveness** | **Complexity** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Install `react-native-polyfill-globals`** (Best Quick Fix) | ✅ High | 🟢 Easy |
| **Use `web-streams-polyfill`** (Manual Polyfill) | ✅ High | 🟡 Medium |
| **Downgrade to AWS SDK v2** | ✅ High | 🟡 Medium |
| **Modify Metro Config (`stream-browserify`)** | ✅ Medium | 🟡 Medium |
| **Use AWS Amplify Instead of AWS SDK v3** | ✅ High | 🔴 High (Requires migration) |

For a **quick fix**, install **`react-native-polyfill-globals`**. If you want **long-term stability**, consider **AWS Amplify**.

## Gemini

The "ReferenceError: Property 'ReadableStream' doesn't exist" error in your React Native project using AWS SDK V3 and Cognito indicates that the JavaScript environment you're using doesn't support the `ReadableStream` API, which is required by certain parts of the AWS SDK, especially for streaming responses.

Here's a breakdown of the problem and potential solutions:

**Understanding the Issue:**

* **React Native's JavaScript Environment:** React Native uses JavaScriptCore on iOS and Hermes on Android by default, which might have limited support for modern web APIs like `ReadableStream`.
* **AWS SDK V3 Dependencies:** The AWS SDK V3 relies on these APIs for efficient handling of streaming data, especially in services like S3 or Kinesis.
* **Expo's Managed Environment:** Expo's managed environment can further restrict access to native modules and APIs, potentially exacerbating the issue.

**Solutions and Workarounds:**

1. **Polyfills:**

   * **Targeted Polyfill:** Install a polyfill specifically for `ReadableStream`. This will provide the missing functionality in your JavaScript environment.
     ```bash
     expo install react-native-streams
     ```
   * **Import:** In your code, import the polyfill before using the AWS SDK:
     ```javascript
     import 'react-native-streams';
     import { CognitoIdentityClient } from "@aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity";
     ```

2. **Upgrade Expo SDK (If Possible):**

   * Newer versions of Expo SDK might have better support for modern web APIs. Check if upgrading your Expo SDK is feasible.

3. **Consider AWS Amplify:**

   * AWS Amplify is a higher-level library built on top of the AWS SDK that simplifies authentication and other common AWS interactions in React Native. It might handle the `ReadableStream` dependency internally.
   * Amplify provides pre-built UI components and handles the underlying authentication flows, making it easier to integrate Cognito into your React Native app.

4. **Custom Native Modules (Advanced):**

   * If you have more flexibility and need fine-grained control, you can create custom native modules that bridge the gap between the AWS SDK and the React Native environment. This requires more advanced native development knowledge.

5. **Alternative Authentication Approaches:**

   * If you're open to exploring other options, consider using a different authentication approach that doesn't rely on the AWS SDK V3 directly.
   * For example, you could use a backend service (e.g., AWS Lambda, API Gateway) to handle the Cognito authentication flow and provide your React Native app with the necessary tokens.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

* **Test on a Physical Device:** Sometimes, issues like this might only appear in the Expo Go simulator. Test your app on a physical device to rule out simulator-specific problems.
* **Check Expo SDK Version:** Ensure you're using a recent Expo SDK version.
* **Inspect Network Requests:** Use browser developer tools or a network proxy to inspect the network requests made by your app. This can help identify any issues with the authentication flow.
* **Examine AWS SDK V3 Documentation:** Review the AWS SDK V3 documentation for any specific requirements or recommendations for React Native environments.
* **Isolate the Issue:** Create a minimal reproducible example to isolate the problem. This will help you determine if it's related to your code or the AWS SDK itself.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Scalability:** Using a backend service for authentication can improve scalability by offloading the authentication logic from your mobile app.
* **Security:** Always follow security best practices when implementing authentication, such as storing tokens securely and using HTTPS.

If you continue to face issues, provide more details about your code, Expo version, and the specific AWS SDK V3 methods you're using. This will help in providing more targeted guidance.

## DeepSeek R1

To resolve the **`ReferenceError: Property 'ReadableStream' doesn't exist`** error when using AWS SDK V3 in a React Native/Expo environment, follow these steps:

---

### **1. Polyfill `ReadableStream`**
Install a polyfill for the Streams API:
```bash
npm install web-streams-polyfill
# or
yarn add web-streams-polyfill
```

**Import the polyfill at the top of your app entry file (e.g., `App.js`):**
```javascript
import 'web-streams-polyfill/es2018'; // Import BEFORE AWS SDK
```

---

### **2. Configure Metro (React Native Bundler)**
Update `metro.config.js` to handle Node.js stream polyfills:
```javascript
// metro.config.js
const { getDefaultConfig } = require('expo/metro-config');

const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

// Add stream and util polyfills
config.resolver.extraNodeModules = {
  stream: require.resolve('stream-browserify'),
  util: require.resolve('util/'),
  ...config.resolver.extraNodeModules,
};

// Enable inline requires for better performance
config.transformer.getTransformOptions = async () => ({
  transform: {
    experimentalImportSupport: false,
    inlineRequires: true,
  },
});

module.exports = config;
```

Install required polyfills:
```bash
npm install stream-browserify util
# or
yarn add stream-browserify util
```

---

### **3. Use AWS Amplify Instead of AWS SDK V3**
AWS Amplify is optimized for React Native and handles polyfills internally. Replace AWS SDK V3 with Amplify’s Auth module:
```bash
npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/auth
# or
yarn add aws-amplify @aws-amplify/auth
```

**Configure Amplify in your app:**
```javascript
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';
import config from './aws-exports'; // Your Cognito config

Amplify.configure(config);

// Use Amplify Auth for authentication
import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify';

async function signIn() {
  try {
    const user = await Auth.signIn(username, password);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('Error signing in:', error);
  }
}
```

---

### **4. Downgrade to AWS SDK V2 (Fallback)**
If polyfills fail, switch to the AWS SDK V2, which is more React Native-friendly:
```bash
npm install aws-sdk
# or
yarn add aws-sdk
```

**Example with AWS SDK V2:**
```javascript
import AWS from 'aws-sdk';

// Configure AWS
AWS.config.update({
  region: 'us-east-1',
  credentials: new AWS.CognitoIdentityCredentials({
    IdentityPoolId: 'YOUR_IDENTITY_POOL_ID',
  }),
});

// Use Cognito
const cognito = new AWS.CognitoIdentityServiceProvider();
cognito.initiateAuth(params, (err, data) => { /* ... */ });
```

---

### **5. Update Babel Configuration**
Add Babel plugins to handle polyfills:
```javascript
// babel.config.js
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
    plugins: [
      '@babel/plugin-transform-runtime', // Add this
    ],
  };
};
```

---

### **6. Verify Expo Compatibility**
Ensure you’re using the latest **Expo SDK** (≥ v47). Older versions may not support certain polyfills.  
- Run `expo upgrade` to update dependencies.
- Avoid deprecated Expo modules that conflict with AWS SDK.

---

### **Why This Happens**
- **React Native Limitations**: React Native’s JavaScript environment lacks web APIs like `ReadableStream`, which AWS SDK V3 may implicitly depend on for streaming responses.
- **AWS SDK V3 Modular Design**: The SDK’s modular architecture uses browser/Node.js-specific features that clash with React Native’s polyfilled environment.

---

### **Final Recommendations**
1. **First Try**: Polyfill `ReadableStream` and update Metro configuration (**Steps 1-2**).  
2. **Best Long-Term Solution**: Migrate to **AWS Amplify** (**Step 3**) for seamless React Native integration.  
3. **Fallback**: Use AWS SDK V2 (**Step 4**) if polyfills are too cumbersome.

By aligning your environment with AWS SDK V3’s requirements or switching to Amplify/V2, the error should resolve. Let me know if you need further help! 🚀

## ChatGPT o1

Below are some approaches you can try to address the “ReferenceError: Property 'ReadableStream' doesn’t exist” error when using AWS SDK v3 (Cognito) in a React Native (Expo) environment. This issue occurs because React Native’s JavaScript runtime does not include all browser APIs like `ReadableStream`.

---

## 1. Use AWS Amplify Auth Instead (Recommended)

If your use case is primarily user authentication, try using the AWS Amplify Auth library, which is built to handle Cognito flows in React Native (including Expo). Amplify abstracts away many of the underlying AWS SDK calls and handles the environment differences:
```bash
# Install Amplify libraries
npm install aws-amplify
```
Then in your app:
```js
import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify';

// Configure
Auth.configure({
  // MandatorySignIn, region, userPoolId, userPoolWebClientId, etc.
});

// Sign in
Auth.signIn(username, password)
  .then(user => { /* handle success */ })
  .catch(err => { /* handle error */ });
```
Amplify is often more stable for React Native and helps avoid some of the manual bridging or polyfill work.  

---

## 2. Polyfill `ReadableStream`

If you need or prefer the raw AWS SDK v3 calls, you must provide a `ReadableStream` implementation so the SDK’s internal logic works in React Native. For that:

1. **Install a Polyfill**  
   A commonly used library is [web-streams-polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-streams-polyfill). Then, import it very early in your app:
   ```bash
   npm install web-streams-polyfill
   ```
   ```js
   // In App.js or similar entry point
   import 'web-streams-polyfill/ponyfill';
   ```

2. **Check Metro Config**  
   - If the polyfill is still not recognized, you may need to ensure your `metro.config.js` is set to include the library. For instance:
     ```js
     // metro.config.js
     module.exports = {
       resolver: {
         // Ensure that the 'web-streams-polyfill' is included
         extraNodeModules: {
           // ...
         },
       },
     };
     ```
   - Usually, just installing and importing is sufficient, but occasionally the bundler might skip it or fail.  

3. **Confirm the Import Order**  
   - Make sure the polyfill is imported before you import anything from AWS SDK v3 so that `ReadableStream` is defined globally.

---

## 3. Disable “Streaming” or “Chunked” Code Paths

In some cases, AWS SDK v3 tries to stream responses. If you can (though not always recommended), you may disable or bypass streaming. For example, if you only call Cognito’s `InitiateAuthCommand`, it may not require streaming – but some sub-dependency might. You can attempt:

- Disabling S3 multi-part uploads or streaming if they’re being pulled in by dependencies. For instance, environment variables like:
  ```bash
  export AWS_S3_DISABLE_MULTIPART=1
  ```
  That might help if the error arises from an S3 usage path, but for Cognito it’s less common.

---

## 4. Verify You’re Using an Up-To-Date React Native + Expo

Older versions of Expo or React Native might break or require extra shims for features the AWS SDK v3 depends on. If possible:

- Use at least **Expo SDK 48 or higher** (or the latest stable).  
- Ensure your React Native version is 0.70+ (or near the version that your Expo SDK uses).  
- This increases the chances that polyfills or Metro bundler configurations are better aligned.

---

## 5. Consider AWS SDK v2 or a Different Approach (Fallback)

If you can’t get the polyfills to behave consistently, you can fallback temporarily to the older **AWS SDK v2** for Cognito or keep your calls minimal until you migrate fully to Amplify. Some folks have found the older SDK simpler for React Native. However, it’s generally better to stick with v3 or Amplify for newer projects.

---

## Summary

1. **Easiest**: Use **Amplify Auth** for handling Cognito in React Native – it manages environment details.  
2. **Polyfill**: If you must stay on AWS SDK v3, install a `ReadableStream` polyfill (`web-streams-polyfill`) and import it before AWS code loads.  
3. **Ensure** your Metro bundler includes the polyfill, and you’re on a recent Expo/React Native version.  
4. **Fallback**: Try AWS SDK v2 or a simpler approach if none of the above solutions work.

This will typically fix the “ReadableStream doesn’t exist” error and allow you to proceed with Cognito authentication in your Expo React Native app.

## Analysis 

Note: The five LLMs have been anonymized in the analysis below, as follows: ChatGPT-4o is Chatbot #1, Gemini 2.0 Flash is Chatbot #2, Q is Chatbot #3, DeepSeek R1 is Chatbot #4 and ChatGPT-o1 is Chatbot #5

Below is a detailed evaluation of each chatbot response, referencing the **baseline answer** from Stack Overflow:

> **Baseline Answer:**  
> 1. To resolve “ReferenceError: Property 'ReadableStream' doesn’t exist,” ensure you have installed and imported the right polyfills in React Native (Expo).  
> 2. Specifically, add something like:
>    ```js
>    import 'react-native-get-random-values';
>    import 'react-native-url-polyfill/auto';
>    import { ReadableStream } from 'web-streams-polyfill/ponyfill';
>    globalThis.ReadableStream = ReadableStream;
>    ```
> 3. Install those packages (react-native-get-random-values, react-native-url-polyfill, web-streams-polyfill), and if it still fails, check for library updates and other auth approaches.

Hence, the baseline basically says:
1. **Install polyfills** for `ReadableStream`.
2. **Import them** at the top of your code (making `ReadableStream` global).
3. Consider alternative libraries if needed (like ensuring compatibility or choosing a different auth solution).
