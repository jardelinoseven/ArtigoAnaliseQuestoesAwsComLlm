struggling to fix: "ReferenceError: Property 'ReadableStream' doesn't exist"
I am working on a project with AWS-SDK V3, Cognito and AWS. I am struggling to setup basic functions, and keep getting errors like: ReferenceError: Property 'ReadableStream' doesn't exist. I can't find anything online, and I am questioning if this is even a good authentication approach for a scalable react native application. Has anyone dealt with this issue or know how to fix it? I am simply trying to use an "initiateauthcommand" from the V3 library, but clearly there are some compatability issues.

For context, I am using an EXPO development environment for my react native ios mobile app.

I tried using metro bundler fixes, doing pollyfilling, none of it worked. I am stumped.


## Highest-scored answer 

Ensure you've added the required polyfills for ReadableStream in your React Native Expo project. Try these imports:

import 'react-native-get-random-values';
import 'react-native-url-polyfill/auto';
import { ReadableStream } from 'web-streams-polyfill/ponyfill';
globalThis.ReadableStream = ReadableStream;

Install necessary packages:

npm install react-native-get-random-values react-native-url-polyfill web-streams-polyfill

If the issue persists, check for library updates and ensure compatibility with React Native. Consider exploring other authentication options based on your project needs.
