## [Question 10](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76049290/error-accesscontrollistnotsupported-when-trying-to-create-a-bucket-acl-in-aws)

What happens to existing AWS IAM users when enable IAM Identity Center?

I want to enable IAM Identity Center and configure an external IdP for an existing AWS account. This AWS account already has users, created with IAM.

What happens to these users?

I'm especially worried about users used by my application to, for example, access S3 buckets. They have no password but only an access key and secret. Will these users' keys work after the configuration of the external IdP?

Thanks

From [Does using the IAM Identity Center affect my IAM identities or federation configuration?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/iam-identity-center-federation/)

>The IAM Identity Center is independent of identity federation configured using IAM. Using the IAM Identity Center doesn't impact IAM identities or your federation configuration.

Note, AWS IAM Identity Center makes it easy to centrally manage access to multiple AWS accounts and provide users with single sign-on access to all their assigned accounts from one place.

If you have only one account, you don't necessarily need to use AWS IAM Identity Center to configure an external IDP (you can, but it's not mandatory), you can also configure an external IDP at the account level (in IAM > Identity providers).

When you enable AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS Single Sign-On), it does not automatically impact existing AWS IAM users and their permissions. IAM Identity Center is a separate service that provides centralized management of user identities and permissions across multiple AWS accounts. Here’s a detailed explanation of what happens and how you can manage permissions in IAM Identity Center:

### What Happens to Existing IAM Users?

1. **IAM Users Remain Unaffected**: Enabling IAM Identity Center does not alter or disable your existing IAM users or their permissions. IAM users will continue to have the same access and permissions they had before enabling IAM Identity Center.

2. **Separate Management**: IAM Identity Center manages a different set of users and permissions from IAM. Users in IAM Identity Center are separate from IAM users, even if they share the same name or email address.

### Managing Permissions with IAM Identity Center

To manage permissions for users in IAM Identity Center, you need to understand how to assign and remove permission sets. Here’s how you can specifically remove a permission set from a user for a specific account:

### Steps to Remove a Permission Set from a User in IAM Identity Center

1. **Access IAM Identity Center**:
   - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to **IAM Identity Center**.

2. **Select Users**:
   - In the left pane, select **Users**.
   - Locate and select the user for whom you want to modify the permissions (e.g., Bob).

3. **Edit Account Assignments**:
   - In the user details page, navigate to the **Assigned accounts** section.
   - Locate the account (e.g., Prod) from which you want to remove the specific permission set.
   - Click on **Manage assignments** or a similar option next to the account.

4. **Modify Permissions**:
   - In the manage assignments section, you will see a list of permission sets assigned to the user for the specific account.
   - Uncheck or remove the **Administrator** permission set while keeping the **ReadOnly** permission set checked.

5. **Save Changes**:
   - Save the changes to update the user’s permissions.

### Verification

- **Review Permissions**: Go back to the **Users** section in IAM Identity Center.
- **Check Assigned Accounts**: Select the user and verify the assigned accounts and permission sets to ensure the changes are correct.

### Impact on IAM Users

- **Existing IAM Users**: The permissions of existing IAM users are not affected by changes made in IAM Identity Center.
- **Identity Center Users**: Changes in IAM Identity Center only affect users managed within IAM Identity Center.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage permissions in IAM Identity Center without impacting your existing IAM users. This allows you to maintain granular control over user access and permissions across your multi-account AWS environment.

IAM Identity Center is a relatively new feature introduced by AWS to simplify user access management across multiple AWS accounts. When you enable IAM Identity Center, it integrates with AWS Organizations to centralize user access management, but it doesn't fundamentally change the existing IAM users or their permissions. Here's what happens to existing IAM users when you enable IAM Identity Center:

1. **No Impact on Existing IAM Users**: Enabling IAM Identity Center doesn't affect the existing IAM users or their permissions. They continue to exist and operate as they did before.

2. **Consolidation of User Management**: IAM Identity Center helps centralize user access management across multiple AWS accounts by providing a single interface for managing permissions and access policies.

Regarding your specific scenario of managing permissions for Bob in a multi-account environment:

1. **Review Permission Sets**: Ensure that you have a clear understanding of the permission sets assigned to Bob across different AWS accounts.

2. **Modify Permission Sets Using IAM Identity Center**: IAM Identity Center provides a centralized interface to manage permission sets. You should be able to modify the permission sets assigned to Bob for specific AWS accounts without deleting or disabling the user or the permission sets.

3. **Fine-Grained Permission Management**: Look for options within IAM Identity Center to adjust Bob's permissions for individual accounts. You should be able to remove the Administrator access for the Prod account while leaving the ReadOnly permission intact.

4. **Utilize IAM Policies**: If IAM Identity Center doesn't provide the granularity you need, consider using IAM policies directly. Create custom policies that define the exact permissions Bob requires for each account, and attach these policies to Bob's IAM user or role.

5. **Testing and Validation**: Before making any changes to permissions, ensure to test the modifications thoroughly to avoid unintended consequences. Validate that Bob's access is restricted as intended after making the changes.

By leveraging IAM Identity Center and potentially custom IAM policies, you should be able to manage Bob's permissions across multiple accounts in a way that meets your requirements without impacting existing users or permission sets unnecessarily.

Enabling IAM Identity Center (IAM IC) does not modify existing IAM users or their permissions. It introduces a new layer of control for managing users and permissions across multiple AWS accounts. Here's a breakdown of what happens:
Impact on Existing IAM Users:
Permissions Remain Intact: Existing IAM users and the permission sets they are assigned within individual accounts will remain unchanged after enabling IAM IC.
Centralized Management: IAM IC allows you to create IAM Identity Center policies that can reference existing IAM permission sets from individual accounts. This enables a more centralized approach to managing permissions across accounts.
Removing Specific Permission Set for a User:
The user's concern about removing Bob's Administrator access for the Prod account while keeping other permissions intact is valid. Here's how to achieve that with IAM IC:
Maintain Existing Permissions: There's no need to delete or disable Bob or the permission sets (Administrator and ReadOnly) entirely.
Use IAM Identity Center Policies: Create an IAM Identity Center policy that grants Bob the ReadOnly permission set for the Prod account. You can reference the existing ReadOnly permission set from the Prod account within this policy.
Override Account Permissions: IAM Identity Center policies take precedence over individual account permissions. This newly created policy will ensure Bob only has ReadOnly access in the Prod account, even though he might have the Administrator permission set assigned directly in that account.
Benefits of this Approach:
Granular Control: You can define fine-grained access permissions for users across multiple accounts using IAM Identity Center policies.
Maintains Existing Permissions: The original IAM permissions and permission sets within individual accounts remain intact for potential future use.
Additional Considerations:
Ensure appropriate permissions for managing IAM Identity Center policies are assigned to users who will be creating and managing these policies.
Thoroughly test any IAM Identity Center policies before deploying them to production to avoid unintended access changes.
By following this approach, the AWS user can achieve the desired outcome of removing Bob's Administrator access for the Prod account while maintaining a centralized and controlled permission management structure using IAM Identity Center.
