Preventing Terraform from assigning reserved IP addresses to resources

I have a scenario where I’m using AWS server setup with an EFS and RDS setup. To enable high availability, I’ve configured a PCS cluster, and as a result, some IP addresses have been reserved as virtual IPs.

For deployment, I’m using a Terraform script. However, I’ve noticed that sometimes during deployments, Terraform automatically assigns these reserved IPs to some resources.

To illustrate, in this setup, the app servers are in a private subnet, and the RDS is also in this private subnet. Sometimes, Terraform assigns one of the IPs, which are reserved for app servers as Virtual IPs, to the RDS.

I want to prevent Terraform from assigning these reserved IPs to any other resource during deployment. What are the best practices or solutions to achieve this in Terraform?

## Highest-scored answer 

Agree with @MarkB . It is AWS that is assigning the IPs, not terraform.

To manage this, I think you could probably use AWS' IPAM, although I haven't used it in this way.

Another approach would be to define the network interfaces in terraform and assign them the reserved IPs. This will create the interfaces with the IPs and then you can assign these interfaces to the resources that need them.

A final approach would be to have a subnet of the reserved IPs and only put the resources that should get them into that subnet.

## Q

Thank you for describing your issue with Terraform assigning reserved IP addresses to resources in your AWS environment. I understand this is causing problems with your high availability setup using a PCS cluster. Let's address this issue step by step:

1. Identify the reserved IP addresses:
   First, create a list of all the IP addresses that are reserved for your virtual IPs in the PCS cluster. This will help you manage them more effectively in your Terraform configuration.

2. Use Terraform's `cidrsubnet` function:
   Instead of allowing Terraform to automatically assign IP addresses, you can use the `cidrsubnet` function to explicitly define IP ranges for your resources. This gives you more control over IP allocation.

3. Implement custom IP allocation:
   Create a custom Terraform module or use a data source to manage your IP allocations. This can help you keep track of used and available IPs, ensuring that reserved IPs are not assigned to other resources.

4. Utilize Terraform's `ignore_changes` attribute:
   For resources where you want to maintain specific IP addresses, use the `ignore_changes` attribute in your Terraform configuration. This prevents Terraform from modifying the IP address after initial creation.

5. Implement IP exclusion lists:
   In your Terraform code, create a list of excluded IPs (your reserved IPs) and use this list when creating resources to ensure these IPs are not assigned.

6. Use Terraform workspaces:
   Consider using Terraform workspaces to separate your infrastructure into different environments. This can help you manage IP allocations more effectively across different setups.

7. Implement pre-deployment checks:
   Create a pre-deployment script or use Terraform's `null_resource` with local-exec provisioner to check if any of the reserved IPs are about to be assigned. If so, halt the deployment.

8. Leverage AWS VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM):
   If you're working at scale, consider using AWS IPAM to manage your IP addresses more effectively. You can integrate this with your Terraform workflows.

To verify that the problem has been solved:

1. Run a Terraform plan and carefully review the proposed changes.
2. After applying changes, use AWS CLI or the console to verify the IP addresses assigned to your resources.
3. Test your PCS cluster functionality to ensure high availability is maintained.

If you continue to face issues after implementing these solutions, I recommend reaching out to AWS Support for more personalized assistance. They can provide guidance specific to your architecture and requirements.

Remember to always test these changes in a non-production environment first to ensure they work as expected and don't disrupt your existing setup.
