## [Question 21](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75533379/aws-elb-returns-status-504-after-10-seconds)

AWS ELB returns status 504 after 10 seconds

I'm getting 504 status code returns when requesting my load balancer, it then transfers the request to a fargate container.

This happens when launching simultaneous calls, some return 200, some 504.

I tried raising the Idle timeout to 60 seconds in the UI as well as in the aws cli but my requests keep timing out after 10 seconds.

Is this normal behavior ? Is their another way to raise this threshold ?

Thanks

## Highest-scored answer 

504 Gateway Timeout means that the ALB couldn't reach the backend, this is also quoted here: "The load balancer failed to establish a connection to the target before the connection timeout expired (10 seconds)."

Raising the timeout (which is an idle connection timeout) has no effect. Please try to troubleshoot the connection between the ALB and the Fargate Container. The first and best check is to see if the TargetGroup is healthy.

The 504 Gateway Timeout error indicates that the load balancer did not receive a timely response from the backend instance (in this case, your Fargate container) within the idle timeout period. Here are some steps to diagnose and resolve this issue:

### 1. Increase Idle Timeout
You mentioned that you have already increased the idle timeout to 60 seconds. Double-check this setting to ensure it is correctly applied. Here’s how you can do it using AWS CLI:

```sh
aws elb modify-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-name <your-load-balancer-name> --load-balancer-attributes "{\"ConnectionSettings\":{\"IdleTimeout\":60}}"
```

For an Application Load Balancer (ALB), you can use:

```sh
aws elbv2 modify-load-balancer-attributes --load-balancer-arn <your-alb-arn> --attributes Key=idle_timeout.timeout_seconds,Value=60
```

### 2. Check Health of Target Group
Ensure that the target group associated with your load balancer has healthy targets. If the targets are unhealthy, the load balancer will not be able to route traffic correctly.

```sh
aws elbv2 describe-target-health --target-group-arn <your-target-group-arn>
```

### 3. Increase Fargate Container Resources
If your Fargate containers are under-provisioned (i.e., they don't have enough CPU or memory), they might be unable to handle the load, causing timeouts. Increase the CPU and memory allocated to your Fargate tasks.

### 4. Scale Out Fargate Tasks
If your application needs to handle a high volume of simultaneous requests, you might need to scale out by increasing the number of Fargate tasks. This can help distribute the load more evenly.

### 5. Application Performance
Ensure that your application is optimized and not taking longer than expected to respond to requests. Look into the following areas:
- Database queries: Ensure they are optimized and indexed.
- External API calls: Ensure they are efficient and have appropriate timeouts.
- Application logic: Ensure there are no bottlenecks.

### 6. Load Balancer Configuration
Ensure that your load balancer’s listener rules and target group settings are correctly configured. Check the following:
- Target type (instance, IP, Lambda).
- Health check settings (path, interval, timeout, healthy/unhealthy threshold).

### 7. Network Configuration
Check your security groups, network ACLs, and routing tables to ensure there are no network issues causing delays or dropped connections.

### Example of Increasing Fargate Task Resources in Task Definition

```json
{
    "family": "your-task-family",
    "containerDefinitions": [
        {
            "name": "your-container-name",
            "image": "your-image",
            "cpu": 512,  // Increase this value
            "memory": 1024,  // Increase this value
            "essential": true,
            "portMappings": [
                {
                    "containerPort": 80,
                    "hostPort": 80
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "requiresCompatibilities": [
        "FARGATE"
    ],
    "networkMode": "awsvpc",
    "cpu": "512",  // Increase this value
    "memory": "1024"  // Increase this value
}
```

### Example of Scaling Fargate Tasks

Using the AWS CLI, you can update the desired count of your service:

```sh
aws ecs update-service --cluster <your-cluster-name> --service <your-service-name> --desired-count <new-desired-count>
```

### Example of Checking and Modifying Health Check Settings

Ensure your health check settings are appropriate for your application’s response time.

```sh
aws elbv2 modify-target-group --target-group-arn <your-target-group-arn> --health-check-interval-seconds 30 --health-check-timeout-seconds 10 --healthy-threshold-count 3 --unhealthy-threshold-count 3
```

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issues causing the 504 Gateway Timeout errors with your AWS Elastic Load Balancer and Fargate containers.



## ChatGPT-4

When encountering a 504 Gateway Timeout error with an AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), especially when dealing with AWS Fargate containers, it suggests that the load balancer is unable to get a response from the backend service within the expected time frame. Here are several steps and considerations to help troubleshoot and potentially resolve this issue:

### 1. **Confirm Load Balancer Timeout Settings**
You mentioned you've adjusted the Idle timeout; this is a good start. The idle timeout setting on the load balancer determines how long a connection remains open without any data being sent. However, ensure that this change has been correctly applied:

- For **Application Load Balancers (ALB)** and **Network Load Balancers (NLB)**, the default idle timeout is 60 seconds, and it can be increased if necessary.
- Use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs to check and modify these settings.

### 2. **Inspect Backend Configuration**
Since you're using Fargate, there are several configurations to consider:
- **Task Definition**: Ensure your container specifications have enough CPU and memory allocated, as insufficient resources can cause slow responses or timeouts.
- **Health Checks**: Verify that health checks for your service are correctly configured and passing. Unhealthy services can lead to a load balancer routing traffic to non-responsive tasks.

### 3. **Analyze Application Performance**
- **Application Bottlenecks**: Look into the application logs and metrics. Check if there's an unusual delay in the processing. Sometimes, the application might be the bottleneck rather than the infrastructure.
- **Concurrency Issues**: Since the issue occurs during simultaneous calls, it's crucial to analyze how your application handles concurrent processing. You may need to optimize your application or adjust the scaling settings in Fargate to accommodate higher loads.

### 4. **Check Network Configuration**
- **Security Groups and NACLs**: Make sure that the network access control lists (NACLs) and security groups are correctly configured to allow inbound and outbound traffic as needed between your load balancer and Fargate containers.

### 5. **Adjust Auto Scaling**
- **Scaling Policies**: If your application experiences high loads intermittently, consider setting up or tuning auto-scaling policies for your Fargate service to handle spikes in traffic more effectively.

### 6. **Review Load Balancer Logs**
- **Access Logs**: Enable and review the ELB access logs to get more insight into the requests and responses. These logs can provide valuable information on the requests that are timing out.

### 7. **Troubleshooting Steps**
- **Test with Simplified Configuration**: Temporarily reduce the complexity of your application or scale down the traffic to see if the issue persists. This can help isolate the problem.
- **Timeout Settings**: Besides idle timeout, check if there are other timeout settings in your application or middleware that might be causing the issue.

### 8. **AWS Support**
If the above steps do not resolve the issue, consider reaching out to AWS Support for more in-depth analysis, especially since this could be related to specific configurations or limits within your AWS environment.

By systematically checking these areas, you can better understand why some requests are timing out and address the root cause of the 504 errors.


## Gemini

The user is encountering 504 (Gateway Timeout) errors from their AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) after 10 seconds when experiencing high volumes of concurrent requests. Here are some possible causes and solutions to investigate:

1. Fargate Container Issues:
Resource Constraints: 
- The 504 timeout might originate from the Fargate containers themselves. Under heavy load, containers might be taking longer than 10 seconds to process requests, causing the ELB to timeout.

  - Solution:

    - Scale Up Containers: Increase the number of Fargate tasks or memory/CPU allocation per container to handle more concurrent requests.
    - Optimize Container Code: Analyze and optimize your container code for efficiency to reduce processing time.
2. ELB Connection Timeout:
- While you've tried increasing the Idle Timeout, the issue might lie with the connection timeout setting.

  - Solution:
        
    - Identify Connection Timeout: Check the ELB configuration in the AWS Management Console or CLI to determine the current connection timeout setting. It might be independent of the Idle Timeout.
    - Increase Connection Timeout (if applicable): If the connection timeout is lower than 10 seconds, consider increasing it to match or slightly exceed the expected container processing time. However, avoid excessively high timeouts.

3. Network Throttling:
- During periods of high traffic, network resources might be temporarily throttled, causing delays that the ELB interprets as timeouts.
  - Solution:

     - Monitor Network Metrics: Use CloudWatch to monitor network metrics like throttling events or errors to identify potential network bottlenecks.
    - Optimize Application Logic: If possible, implement features like request batching or queuing in your application to reduce the number of concurrent requests sent to the ELB.
4. CloudWatch Logs:
  - Solution:
    - Enable CloudWatch Logs for your ELB and Fargate tasks. Analyze the logs for any errors or warnings that might provide clues about the root cause of the timeouts.

Additional Tips:

- Consider using health checks in your ELB configuration to identify unhealthy containers and remove them from the load balancing pool automatically.
- If you're using Application Load Balancer (ALB), explore features like connection draining to gracefully remove unhealthy targets from the pool.
By investigating these potential causes and implementing appropriate solutions, the AWS user should be able to reduce or eliminate the 504 timeouts and ensure smooth operation of their load balancer under heavy traffic conditions. Remember to adjust timeouts and resource allocation based on your specific application's needs.
