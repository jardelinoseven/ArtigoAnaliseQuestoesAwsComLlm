Stop AWS OpenSearch service temporarily for cost savings

I am looking at doing some cost savings in AWS and want to know if we can stop and then start the AWS Opensearch service for a couple of days.

My scenario is that the application which uses the OpenSearch service (Elasticsearch) remains down during 2 days every week... During this time OpenSearch remains active and incurs costs...

I know one option to save the costs is to downgrade the node type and reduce the number of nodes during the application downtime.

But let me know if there are any other options where I can entirely "Switch Off" and "Switch On" the service just like we can do with EC2 instances.

## Highest-scored answer 

There is no way to stop the cluster today. What I have seen to reduce bill was that team edited the cluster to reduce the instance type to a t2.small (or smaller ones) instance which is significantly cheaper than the previous instance.

Then when they needed to resume testing they changed the instance type back to what they required.

One other thing maybe is to take a snapshot of your domain, the disable Opensearch for the weekend. Finally restore it back on monday with the snapshot you got.

As of now, AWS OpenSearch Service (formerly Amazon Elasticsearch Service) does not support the ability to "switch off" and "switch on" the service in the same way you can with EC2 instances. This is because OpenSearch Service is a managed service designed to be available and resilient, which includes automatic scaling, patching, and availability features.

However, there are several strategies you can employ to reduce costs when your application is not using the OpenSearch cluster:

### 1. Scale Down the Cluster
You can reduce the number of nodes or switch to smaller instance types during the downtime.

- **Reduce the Number of Nodes**: If you have a multi-node cluster, you can reduce the number of data nodes during the downtime.
- **Change Instance Types**: Switch to less expensive instance types temporarily.

### Example of Scaling Down the Cluster

You can use the AWS Management Console, CLI, or SDK to update the instance type and number of nodes.

#### Using AWS CLI
To scale down the cluster, you can update the instance type and the number of nodes using the AWS CLI:

```sh
aws opensearch update-domain-config \
  --domain-name my-domain \
  --cluster-config "InstanceType=r5.large.search,InstanceCount=1"
```

Replace `my-domain` with your OpenSearch domain name, `r5.large.search` with your desired instance type, and `InstanceCount=1` with the desired number of instances.

### 2. Automate the Scaling Process
You can automate the scaling up and down process using AWS Lambda, CloudWatch Events, or Step Functions to run on a schedule.

#### Example Using AWS Lambda and CloudWatch Events

1. **Create Lambda Functions**: One to scale down the cluster and another to scale it back up.

```python
# lambda_scale_down.py
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    client = boto3.client('opensearch')
    response = client.update_domain_config(
        DomainName='my-domain',
        ClusterConfig={
            'InstanceType': 'r5.large.search',
            'InstanceCount': 1
        }
    )
    return response
```

```python
# lambda_scale_up.py
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    client = boto3.client('opensearch')
    response = client.update_domain_config(
        DomainName='my-domain',
        ClusterConfig={
            'InstanceType': 'r5.xlarge.search',
            'InstanceCount': 3
        }
    )
    return response
```

2. **Create CloudWatch Events**: Schedule events to trigger the Lambda functions.

```sh
aws events put-rule --schedule-expression "cron(0 0 ? * MON *)" --name scale-down-opensearch
aws events put-rule --schedule-expression "cron(0 0 ? * WED *)" --name scale-up-opensearch
```

3. **Add Targets to the Rules**:

```sh
aws events put-targets --rule scale-down-opensearch --targets "Id"="1","Arn"="arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:lambda_scale_down"
aws events put-targets --rule scale-up-opensearch --targets "Id"="1","Arn"="arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:lambda_scale_up"
```

### 3. Snapshot and Delete the Domain (Advanced)
If the data is not required to be immediately available and can be restored from a snapshot, you can take a snapshot of the domain, delete the domain, and then recreate it from the snapshot when needed. This approach involves more downtime and complexity but can save costs significantly.

### Steps:

1. **Take a Snapshot**:

```sh
aws opensearch create-snapshot --domain-name my-domain --snapshot-name my-snapshot
```

2. **Delete the Domain**:

```sh
aws opensearch delete-domain --domain-name my-domain
```

3. **Recreate the Domain from Snapshot**:
When you need the domain again, create a new domain and restore the snapshot.

```sh
aws opensearch create-domain --domain-name my-domain --cluster-config "InstanceType=r5.large.search,InstanceCount=1"
aws opensearch restore-snapshot --domain-name my-domain --snapshot-name my-snapshot
```

### Summary
- **Scaling Down**: Reduce the number of nodes or change instance types during downtime.
- **Automation**: Use Lambda and CloudWatch Events to automate scaling.
- **Snapshot and Restore**: For significant cost savings, snapshot the domain and delete it, then restore it when needed (more advanced and involves downtime).

By using these strategies, you can effectively manage and reduce the costs associated with running an AWS OpenSearch Service cluster during periods of inactivity.



## ChatGPT-4

In AWS, the OpenSearch Service (formerly known as Elasticsearch Service) doesn't offer a native option to "stop" and "start" clusters similar to how you can with EC2 instances. This limitation means that once a cluster is provisioned, it continues to accrue charges based on the resources it consumes (e.g., instance types, storage) until it is either deleted or modified to use fewer resources.

Here are some strategies to manage costs associated with AWS OpenSearch Service effectively, considering that stopping the service entirely like an EC2 instance isn't an option:

### 1. **Scale Down During Downtime**
As you mentioned, one approach is to scale down the resources during periods of inactivity. You can reduce the number of nodes and switch to cheaper node types. This can be automated using AWS Lambda functions triggered by CloudWatch events or a cron schedule:

- **Automate Scaling**: Write Lambda functions that modify the OpenSearch cluster settings using the `UpdateElasticsearchDomainConfig` API to scale down at the beginning of the downtime and scale back up before the workload resumes.
- **Consider Data Resilience**: Ensure that the scaling actions do not compromise your data resilience or availability. For instance, if you reduce the cluster to a single node, you might temporarily lose redundancy.

### 2. **Automated Snapshots and Cluster Rebuilds**
A more drastic but cost-effective approach could be to take snapshots of your cluster before shutting it down and then delete the cluster. When operations need to resume, you could restore the cluster from the snapshot:

- **Snapshot Management**: Ensure automated snapshots are enabled, and possibly take a manual snapshot through the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI before deletion.
- **Delete and Restore**: Delete the cluster after taking snapshots and restore it from these snapshots before your application needs to go live again. Be aware that restoration times can vary depending on the size of the snapshot and the cluster configuration.

### 3. **Use Reserved Instances**
If your usage pattern is predictable (e.g., knowing that you will consistently use OpenSearch throughout the year but at varying capacities), consider purchasing Reserved Instances for OpenSearch. Reserved Instances provide a significant discount compared to on-demand pricing:

- **Evaluate Cost Benefits**: Analyze your usage to determine if Reserved Instances could offer cost savings over the long term, especially if part of the cluster remains active continuously.

### 4. **Leverage a Smaller Development Environment for Testing**
If the primary concern is non-production environments that do not need to be large scale:
- **Downsize Non-Production Clusters**: Use smaller instances and fewer nodes for development, testing, or staging environments.

### 5. **Monitoring and Alerts**
Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor usage and cost. Set alerts to understand usage patterns and optimize costs:
- **Set Budgets and Alerts**: Use AWS Budgets to keep track of costs and get alerts when the spending goes beyond a predefined threshold.

### Implementing Automation

Hereâ€™s an example using AWS CLI commands wrapped in a Lambda function for automating scaling actions:

```python
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    client = boto3.client('opensearch')

    # Scale down
    response = client.update_domain_config(
        DomainName='your-domain-name',
        ClusterConfig={
            'InstanceType': 't2.small.elasticsearch',
            'InstanceCount': 1
        }
    )

    return response
```

This function can be scheduled to run at specific times using Amazon EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events). Remember, any automation involving cluster size changes should consider the time required for changes to apply and the potential impact on cluster performance and availability.

### Conclusion

While you cannot "stop" and "start" AWS OpenSearch clusters as you can with EC2, these approaches can help manage costs by reducing the scale of the service during known downtimes or completely tearing down and restoring environments based on your operational schedules.

Unfortunately, AWS OpenSearch Service (formerly known as Elasticsearch Service) currently lacks a built-in feature to completely stop and start the service like you can with EC2 instances. Here are some alternative approaches to consider for cost savings during your application's downtime:
1. Downsize Cluster Resources:
As you mentioned, downgrading the node type and reducing the number of nodes in your OpenSearch cluster is an effective strategy. This reduces the compute resources utilized and lowers your costs.
2. Utilize Reserved Instances (RIs):
If your application has predictable downtime schedules, consider using AWS Reserved Instances (RIs) for your OpenSearch cluster. RIs offer significant cost savings compared to on-demand pricing, especially for consistent usage patterns. Choose a reservation term that aligns with your downtime duration (e.g., All Uptime or Scheduled).
3. Implement Automated Scaling with CloudWatch:
Set up auto-scaling for your OpenSearch cluster using CloudWatch. During your application downtime, configure CloudWatch to automatically scale down the number of nodes based on pre-defined metrics like CPU utilization. This reduces resource usage and costs when demand is low.
4. Explore Serverless Options:
If your OpenSearch usage is more sporadic, consider exploring serverless options like AWS OpenSearch Serverless. This option automatically provisions and scales resources based on your workload, eliminating idle costs during downtime.
5. Leverage Data Snapshots and Restore:
While not ideal for frequent downtime, you could potentially create snapshots of your OpenSearch data periodically during uptime. Then, during the downtime window, you could delete the OpenSearch cluster altogether. When your application restarts, you can restore the data from the snapshot to rebuild the cluster. This approach requires careful planning and potentially longer startup times after restoring the data.
Additional Considerations:
Evaluate the impact of stopping and starting the service frequently. OpenSearch may require some time for initialization after being restarted, potentially causing delays for your application.
Choose the approach that best aligns with your application's downtime schedule, workload patterns, and cost optimization goals.
By implementing one of these approaches (or a combination), you can achieve significant cost savings while your application using OpenSearch is down. Consider the trade-offs of each method to find the best fit for your specific scenario.
