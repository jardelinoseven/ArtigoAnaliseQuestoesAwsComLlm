AWS Redshift Serverless IAM Identity Center Autnethication not working

I am trying to use Redshift Query Editor V2 authenticating via IAM Identity Center. These were my setup steps:

* Created IAM Identity Center in the same region as the Serverless Workgroup
* Created a Serverless Redshift instance (note I tried both private and publicly accessible workgroup, also being deployed on public subnets)
* Create IAM Identity Center Application via the Redshift console and I have enabled the Query editor v2 application
* Added the IAM IdC group containing my user (which is a group that has Administrator privilieges, therefore it is not a credentials limitation issue)
* In Redshift (accessing it as superuser) I created an identity provider with this query:

```sql
CREATE IDENTITY PROVIDER "redshift-idc-app" TYPE AWSIDC
NAMESPACE 'awsidc'
APPLICATION_ARN 'arn:aws:sso::123456789012:application/ssoins-12345f67fe123d4/apl-a0b0a12dc123b1a4'
IAM_ROLE 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyRedshiftRole';
```

Note the role has this trust relationship

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": [
                    "redshift.amazonaws.com",
                    "redshift-serverless.amazonaws.com"
                ]
            },
            "Action": [
                "sts:AssumeRole",
                "sts:SetContext"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

and these permissions:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "redshift:DescribeQev2IdcApplications",
                "redshift-serverless:ListNamespaces",
                "redshift-serverless:ListWorkgroups"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Sid": "AllowRetrievalOfRSMetadata"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "sso:DescribeApplication",
                "sso:DescribeInstance"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:sso::597598337678:application/ssoins-69876c8b1312f277/*",
                "arn:aws:sso:::instance/ssoins-69876c8b1312f277"
            ],
            "Sid": "AllowCreationOfIdPProvider"
        }
    ]
}
```

I ensured the role was created as expected:

```sql
SELECT * FROM SVV_IDENTITY_PROVIDERS;
```

* Finally I created a role in Redshift with the namespace of the provider for the group that I assigned in the group section of the `IAM Identity Center connection` application:

```sql
CREATE ROLE <idcnamespace:rolename>;

-- See the available roles
SELECT * FROM SVV_ROLES;
```

and assign permissions on a schema inside one of the databases (note that I pre-created the schema in the given database as well):

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema> TO ROLE "<idcnamespace:rolename>";
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema> TO ROLE "<idcnamespace:rolename>";
```

When I try to login I get this error on the QEV2 console: `Databases couldn't be listed`. However upon further investigation on Cloudtrail I can see these details on the event:

```json
{
"errorCode": "InternalServerErrorException",
    "requestParameters": {
        "path": "/cluster/connect/",
        "data": "***",
        "version": "1.001"
    },
    "responseElements": {
        "result": false,
        "code": "ContainerStateException",
        "error": "Cannot get container for user AROAYWI5C7KHET6MY5CL5:<USERNAME>",
        "message": "Cannot get container for user AROAYWI5C7KHET6MY5CL5:<USERNAME>"
    }
}
```

I couldn't find anything in the documentation about this specific error. I basically followed [this AWS guide](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/integrate-okta-with-amazon-redshift-query-editor-v2-using-aws-iam-identity-center-for-seamless-single-sign-on/) step by step, yet no luck unfortunately :(
Any help of what I might have messed up in the setup or elsewhere is much appreciated :)

## UPDATE

The AWS team is probably working on something here, because now for the same setup/steps, the error has changed to an `ISACGetSessionException`.

```json
"responseElements": {
        "result": false,
        "code": "ISACGetSessionException",
        "error": "Cannot get session information from ISAC",
        "message": "Cannot get session information from ISAC"
}
```

Can't really tell what the hell is going on here. I wish the AWS team was a bit more transparent on disclaiming that the IDC integration with Redshift Serverless is "experimental" to say the least... Will keep anyone posted on updates


## Baseline answer 

One likely reason is that third-party cookies from amazon.com to amazonaws.com are blocked by your browser. You can check if this is happening in the Network tab by inspecting the Cookies on the sqlworkbench api requests. Check "show filtered out request cookies" to see whether these cookies are being blocked. You can see them highlighted in yellow. 

The way to unblock these cookies will depend on the browser you're using. In Google Chrome, you can allow them by clicking the eye icon at the right end of the address bar. 

You may then have to Delete Connection and then Create Connection.  


## ChatGPT 4o

The errors **"ContainerStateException: Cannot get container for user"** and **"ISACGetSessionException: Cannot get session information from ISAC"** suggest that **AWS IAM Identity Center (IdC) authentication with Redshift Serverless is not fully initializing the user session**. Since AWS seems to be actively making changes to this integration, the issue may be related to an incomplete setup, permission misalignment, or an underlying AWS service issue.

---

## **Possible Causes & Solutions**
### **1. Ensure IAM Identity Center User is Mapped to Redshift Role Correctly**
- The **Identity Center user must be assigned to the correct IAM Identity Center group**.
- The **group must be mapped to a valid Redshift role**.

#### **How to Check?**
1. Run:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM SVV_IDENTITY_PROVIDER_ROLES;
   ```
   - Verify that the **IdC user/group is mapped to a valid role**.

2. If the role is missing, manually create a mapping:
   ```sql
   CREATE ROLE "awsidc:Administrator";
   GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema> TO ROLE "awsidc:Administrator";
   GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema> TO ROLE "awsidc:Administrator";
   ```

✅ **Solution:** If the user-to-role mapping is missing, manually assign it using the `CREATE ROLE` and `GRANT` statements.

---

### **2. Ensure Redshift Serverless Workgroup is Accessible**
- If the **workgroup is private**, IAM Identity Center may not be able to resolve the session.

#### **How to Check?**
1. Run:
   ```sh
   aws redshift-serverless list-workgroups --region <your-region>
   ```
   2. Ensure the workgroup is **reachable** and has `publiclyAccessible: true` (or is in a subnet with access).

✅ **Solution:** If using a **private workgroup**, ensure Identity Center users can **connect via VPN, Direct Connect, or an AWS PrivateLink**.

---

### **3. Validate IAM Role Trust Policy**
AWS **Redshift Serverless** requires **IAM role assumption permissions**.

#### **How to Check?**
Run:
```sh
aws sts assume-role --role-arn arn:aws:iam::<your-account-id>:role/MyRedshiftRole --role-session-name test-session
```
If this **fails**, there’s a trust policy issue.

✅ **Solution:** Modify the **trust policy** to explicitly allow Redshift Serverless:
```json
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
        "Service": [
            "redshift.amazonaws.com",
            "redshift-serverless.amazonaws.com"
        ]
    },
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
}
```

---

### **4. Check IAM Identity Center Session Limits**
AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO) sessions are **limited to a specific duration** and can expire.

#### **How to Check?**
1. Go to **IAM Identity Center → Settings → Session Duration**.
2. Increase session timeout to **12 hours**.

✅ **Solution:** If your session **expires**, re-login and try again.

---

### **5. Validate `awsidc` Namespace Setup**
Your `CREATE IDENTITY PROVIDER` statement uses the namespace **`awsidc`**, but AWS might expect a **different format**.

#### **How to Check?**
1. Verify your existing identity providers:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM SVV_IDENTITY_PROVIDERS;
   ```
   2. If `awsidc` is not listed, try using the **full IAM Identity Center ARN**.

✅ **Solution:** If `awsidc` doesn’t work, **recreate the provider using a full ARN**.

---

### **6. Clear Existing Stuck Sessions**
A stuck session might be preventing new connections.

#### **How to Check?**
1. List active sessions:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM SVV_SESSIONS;
   ```
2. Terminate any stuck session:
   ```sql
   SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM SVV_SESSIONS WHERE user_name = '<your-user>';
   ```

✅ **Solution:** Restart the session after clearing stale connections.

---

## **Final Checklist**
| **Potential Issue** | **How to Check?** | **Solution** |
|---------------------|------------------|--------------|
| **IAM Identity Center role not mapped correctly** | `SELECT * FROM SVV_IDENTITY_PROVIDER_ROLES;` | `CREATE ROLE "awsidc:Administrator";` |
| **Workgroup is inaccessible** | `aws redshift-serverless list-workgroups` | Make it **publicly accessible** or use **PrivateLink** |
| **IAM Role assumption issues** | `aws sts assume-role` | Fix trust policy for `redshift-serverless.amazonaws.com` |
| **SSO session expired** | IAM Identity Center → Settings | Increase session timeout to **12 hours** |
| **Incorrect `awsidc` namespace** | `SELECT * FROM SVV_IDENTITY_PROVIDERS;` | Use full ARN instead of `awsidc` |
| **Stuck sessions blocking access** | `SELECT * FROM SVV_SESSIONS;` | Terminate sessions using `pg_terminate_backend(pid)` |

---

## **Conclusion**
Since AWS appears to be **actively modifying Redshift IAM Identity Center authentication**, some of these issues may be related to AWS-side updates. However, following these **fixes should restore access**.

## Gemini

It seems you've encountered a frustrating issue with IAM Identity Center (IdC) authentication for Redshift Serverless Query Editor V2. The errors you're seeing, "ContainerStateException" and "ISACGetSessionException," suggest problems with the integration between Redshift Serverless and IdC.

Here's a breakdown of potential causes and troubleshooting steps, considering the information you've provided and the updates:

**Potential Causes**

* **IdC Integration Issues:** As you suspected, the IdC integration with Redshift Serverless might still be under development or have some limitations. The changing error messages could indicate ongoing changes on the AWS side.
* **Application Configuration:** There might be subtle misconfigurations in your IdC application or the way it's linked to Redshift Serverless. Double-check all the settings, including the application ARN, IAM role, and group mappings.
* **Network Connectivity:** Even though you've tried both private and public workgroups, there could still be network connectivity issues between Redshift Serverless, IdC, and the Query Editor V2.
* **Redshift Serverless and Query Editor V2 Versions:** Ensure you're using the latest versions of Redshift Serverless and Query Editor V2. There might be compatibility issues with older versions.
* **IAM Role Permissions:** While your IAM role seems to have the necessary permissions, it's worth reviewing them again to ensure they align with the latest requirements for IdC integration.
* **Session Management:** The "ISACGetSessionException" points to a problem with establishing or managing the session between Query Editor V2, IdC, and Redshift Serverless. This could be due to issues with token exchange, validation, or session duration.

**Troubleshooting Steps**

1. **Contact AWS Support:** Since the issue might be related to the IdC integration itself, contacting AWS Support is highly recommended. They can provide insights into the specific errors and any known limitations or workarounds.

2. **Review IdC Application Configuration:**
   * **Application ARN:** Verify that the application ARN in your `CREATE IDENTITY PROVIDER` statement is accurate.
   * **Group Mappings:** Double-check that the IdC group containing your user is correctly mapped to the appropriate Redshift role in the IdC application settings.
   * **Token Settings:** Review the token settings in your IdC application, such as token expiration and refresh intervals.

3. **Check Network Connectivity:**
   * If you're using a private workgroup, ensure that there's proper network connectivity between your VPC and IdC. This might involve VPC endpoints or other networking configurations.
   * If you're using a public workgroup, ensure that there are no firewall rules or network restrictions blocking access to IdC or the Query Editor V2.

4. **Update Redshift Serverless and Query Editor V2:** If updates are available, update your Redshift Serverless workgroup and Query Editor V2 to the latest versions.

5. **Re-examine IAM Role Permissions:** Review the IAM role's permissions and compare them to the latest documentation for IdC integration. Ensure that the role has all the necessary permissions to interact with IdC and Redshift Serverless.

6. **Test with a Different IdC User:** Try logging in with a different IdC user to see if the issue is specific to your user account.

7. **Simplify the Setup:** If possible, create a new, minimal Redshift Serverless workgroup and IdC application to test the integration with a basic configuration. This can help isolate the problem.

**Additional Considerations**

* **AWS Documentation:** Keep an eye on the AWS documentation for any updates or changes related to IdC integration with Redshift Serverless.
* **AWS Forums and Communities:** Search for similar issues in AWS forums or online communities. Other users might have encountered the same problem and found solutions or workarounds.

**Keeping Updated**

As you mentioned, the AWS team might be actively working on improving the IdC integration. It's a good idea to stay updated on any announcements or releases related to Redshift Serverless and IdC. You can do this by:

* **Following AWS Blogs:** Subscribe to relevant AWS blogs, such as the AWS Big Data Blog.
* **Checking AWS What's New:** Regularly check the AWS What's New page for announcements.
* **Monitoring AWS Service Health Dashboard:** Keep an eye on the AWS Service Health Dashboard for any reported issues with Redshift Serverless or IdC.

By diligently troubleshooting and staying informed, you can hopefully resolve the authentication issue and successfully use IAM Identity Center with your Redshift Serverless workgroup.

To resolve the **IAM Identity Center (IdC) authentication issues with Amazon Redshift Serverless**, follow these structured steps:

---

### **1. Validate IAM Role Trust Policy**
Ensure the IAM role used in the `CREATE IDENTITY PROVIDER` command includes the correct trust relationship for both Redshift and Redshift Serverless:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": [
          "redshift.amazonaws.com",
          "redshift-serverless.amazonaws.com"
        ]
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```
- **Remove `sts:SetContext`** (not required and may cause errors).

---

### **2. Expand IAM Role Permissions**
Add missing permissions to the IAM role to enable session management and IdC integration:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowSessionAndSSOAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "sso:GetSession",
        "sso:ListDirectoryAssociations",
        "redshift-serverless:GetCredentials",
        "redshift:GetClusterCredentials"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### **3. Verify Namespace and Role Configuration**
- Ensure the **namespace** in `CREATE IDENTITY PROVIDER` matches the role’s namespace exactly:
  ```sql
  CREATE IDENTITY PROVIDER "redshift-idc-app" TYPE AWSIDC
  NAMESPACE 'awsidc'  -- Must match the role's namespace
  APPLICATION_ARN 'arn:aws:sso::123456789012:application/ssoins-12345f67fe123d4/apl-a0b0a12dc123b1a4'
  IAM_ROLE 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyRedshiftRole';
  ```

- Confirm the Redshift role uses the correct namespace prefix:
  ```sql
  CREATE ROLE "awsidc:AnalystRole";  -- Example
  ```

---

### **4. Check IAM Identity Center Application Assignment**
- In the **AWS IAM Identity Center Console**:
  1. Navigate to **Applications** → **Redshift Query Editor V2**.
  2. Verify the user/group is assigned to the application.
  3. Ensure **Session duration** is configured (e.g., 1 hour).

---

### **5. Inspect Redshift Serverless Workgroup Network Settings**
- If using a **private VPC**:
  - Confirm the VPC has a route to the internet (NAT Gateway) or AWS SSO endpoints.
  - Ensure security groups allow outbound HTTPS (port 443) to `*.aws.amazon.com`.
- For **public accessibility**:
  - Verify the workgroup’s subnet has an Internet Gateway.

---

### **6. Test with Simplified Permissions**
Temporarily grant the Redshift role **superuser privileges** to isolate permission issues:
```sql
GRANT CREATE USER, CREATE GROUP TO ROLE "awsidc:AnalystRole";
```
If this resolves the error, refine permissions incrementally.

---

### **7. Recreate the Identity Provider and Role**
1. Drop the existing identity provider and role:
   ```sql
   DROP IDENTITY PROVIDER "redshift-idc-app";
   DROP ROLE "awsidc:AnalystRole";
   ```
2. Recreate them using exact ARNs and namespaces.

---

### **8. Enable Debug Logging**
- **Redshift Serverless**:
  - Enable **audit logging** in the workgroup and check logs in Amazon CloudWatch.
- **AWS CloudTrail**:
  - Filter events for `redshift-serverless.amazonaws.com` and `sso.amazonaws.com` to capture detailed errors.

---

### **9. Verify AWS Region Consistency**
Ensure **Redshift Serverless**, **IAM Identity Center**, and the **IAM role** are all in the **same AWS region**.

---

### **10. Contact AWS Support**
If the error persists or transitions to `ISACGetSessionException`, it may indicate an AWS-side issue. Provide:
- Redshift Workgroup ARN
- IAM Identity Center Application ARN
- CloudTrail Event IDs

---

### **Common Pitfalls**
- **Namespace Typos**: Mismatched namespaces between IdP and roles.
- **IAM Role Permissions**: Missing `sso:GetSession` or `redshift-serverless:GetCredentials`.
- **VPC Configuration**: Blocked outbound traffic to IdC endpoints.

By addressing these areas, the authentication flow should succeed. Let me know if you need further guidance! 🚀

## ChatGPT o1

Below are some likely causes and troubleshooting steps for when Redshift Serverless + IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO) integration fails and you see errors like “Cannot get container for user” or “Cannot get session information from ISAC.” In short, Redshift Serverless still has some rough edges for IAM Identity Center logins, and some of the existing documentation/blogs (particularly for Okta or “regular” Redshift) may not fully apply. However, there are a few checks and known workarounds you can try.

---

## 1. Make Sure Redshift Serverless is Actually Supported for IDC SSO

Although the blog you linked shows a similar flow, it primarily references standard (provisioned) Redshift clusters. Redshift Serverless gained support for AWS IDC-based single sign-on more recently, and AWS docs can lag behind new features. In particular, some regions or partial back-end changes can cause these “ISACGetSessionException” or “Cannot get container” errors when Serverless tries to attach the ephemeral “container” session to the user.  

**Next Steps**:
- **Try** in a different region that is known to fully support all Redshift Serverless features.  
- **Check** AWS Release Notes / forums / contact AWS Support if you suspect a region-specific or service “preview” limitation.  
- If you have a direct reference from AWS docs or a recent blog specifically calling out Redshift Serverless + IDC, confirm that your region is in the supported list.

---

## 2. Double-Check the Redshift “Namespace” and Provider Setup

You’re correctly creating an identity provider using `CREATE IDENTITY PROVIDER ... NAMESPACE 'awsidc' TYPE AWSIDC ...`. Make sure:

1. **NAMESPACE**: The “awsidc” namespace is indeed what you see in the AWS docs for the IDC integration. Some versions / older docs might specify “oidc” or “saml”. For the new AWS IAM Identity Center, “awsidc” is typically correct, but do confirm that’s the official recommended value for the Serverless approach.  
2. **APPLICATION_ARN**: Double-check that the ARN used in your `CREATE IDENTITY PROVIDER` statement exactly matches the “Application” from your AWS SSO / IDC console – especially if you created more than one “IAM Identity Center connection” for Redshift.  
3. **Roles**: You created roles via `CREATE ROLE "<awsidc:ROLE_NAME>"`. Make sure that exactly matches the group name you assigned in the IAM Identity Center “Users & Groups” tab for the Redshift app.  

   For example, if your group in IAM Identity Center is named “DataScientists,” you’d run:
   ```sql
   CREATE ROLE "awsidc:DataScientists";
   GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema> TO ROLE "awsidc:DataScientists";
   ```
   The key is that the literal text `awsidc:` plus the group name must match exactly.

4. **Check for a “LOGIN” Privilege**: In “classic” Redshift, `CREATE USER` or `CREATE GROUP` is used, and you give them `LOGIN` if needed. For an IDC role, you typically just need to have the role exist. But sometimes you also need to `GRANT CREATE SESSION` or `GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE` depending on your database usage:
   ```sql
   GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE mydb TO ROLE "awsidc:DataScientists";
   ```
   This can vary depending on your Redshift version, but it’s worth trying if you’re missing a “connect” permission.

---

## 3. Verify the Underlying IAM Role Policy for Redshift Serverless

When using a provisioned Redshift cluster, you’d attach a custom IAM role to the cluster. For Redshift Serverless, you associate an IAM role with the workgroup. Double-check:

1. **Which IAM role** is actually attached to your Serverless workgroup – it might differ from the role you used in `CREATE IDENTITY PROVIDER`. You can see it in the AWS console under Redshift Serverless -> Workgroups -> (Your Workgroup) -> “Associated IAM roles.”  
2. **Trust policy**: Must allow `redshift-serverless.amazonaws.com` and `redshift.amazonaws.com` to assume the role.  
3. **Permissions**: It should have at least the statement for describing the application, instance, etc.:
   ```json
   {
     "Action": [
       "sso:DescribeApplication",
       "sso:DescribeInstance"
     ],
     "Effect": "Allow",
     "Resource": "*"
   }
   ```
   and relevant “redshift:*” or “redshift-serverless:*” calls.

If your `CREATE IDENTITY PROVIDER` used a role different from the one the workgroup is using, that mismatch can lead to “Cannot get session” or “Cannot get container” errors.

---

## 4. Check for an AWS Internal Issue or Outage

Errors like `ISACGetSessionException` or “Cannot get container” sometimes indicate internal service trouble. For example, if the identity center session token can’t be translated into an ephemeral Redshift “container” session behind the scenes, it might be an AWS backend bug. This can manifest as:

- **Intermittent**: You had the same setup working, but it spontaneously fails with “Cannot get container.”  
- **Regional**: Only failing in a single region, working in another.  
- **Ongoing**: If you see it consistently for days, it may be a misconfiguration. If it’s sporadic, it may be internal.

**Recommended**:  
- Check the [AWS Health Dashboard](https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status) or Redshift forums to see if there’s an ongoing issue with Redshift / Identity Center in your region.  
- Open a **support ticket** with AWS – the “Cannot get session from ISAC” strongly suggests an internal service mismatch that only AWS can diagnose in their logs.

---

## 5. Try a Known Working Approach First (for Testing)

To isolate whether the problem is specifically related to the new IDC-based “native” integration, you could try:

1. **Plain IAM Database Authentication**: Where you call `sts:GetClusterCredentials` from your front-end or CLI, then connect to Redshift with short-lived credentials. Redshift Serverless can also use that. This might confirm your cluster is otherwise healthy.  
2. **Temporary Switch** to a “standard” Redshift user for testing:  
   ```sql
   CREATE USER testuser WITH PASSWORD 'StrongPwd1!';
   GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema> TO testuser;
   GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE mydb TO testuser;
   ```
   If that user can list databases fine in Query Editor V2, then the problem is specifically with the identity center path, not the cluster itself.

If these older / more traditional methods work, you know the problem is purely in the IDC -> Redshift integration or the role / identity provider setup.

---

### Summary

1. **Check** that Redshift Serverless in your region supports IDC-based SSO for Query Editor v2, and confirm the feature is out of “preview.”  
2. **Double-check** the `CREATE IDENTITY PROVIDER` parameters (namespace, application ARN, IAM role) match your actual IAM Identity Center application.  
3. **Ensure** the Redshift roles match the group names in the SSO console. Also consider `GRANT CONNECT` on the DB to that role.  
4. **Confirm** the IAM role you reference is indeed attached to your Redshift Serverless workgroup and has the correct trust + permission policies.  
5. **Watch** for AWS-side issues. The “ISACGetSessionException” often indicates an internal Redshift/IDC handshake problem. Open a support case if steps above don’t resolve it.

Following these checks usually resolves the “Cannot get container” / “ISACGetSessionException” errors when setting up Redshift Serverless + IAM Identity Center SSO for Query Editor V2. However, if you still see the errors even after verifying configuration, it may require AWS Support to investigate deeper in the backend logs.

Below is a detailed evaluation of each chatbot response compared to the **baseline** Stack Overflow answer.

## Baseline Answer (Summary)

A user encountered an issue with **Redshift Serverless** + **IAM Identity Center** (formerly AWS SSO) authentication for the Redshift Query Editor V2. The user sees errors like `ISACGetSessionException` and “Cannot get container,” which appear to be AWS-side or internal issues. The baseline solution strongly suggests that the real cause might be that **third-party cookies from amazon.com to amazonaws.com** are blocked by the browser. The user should check the browser’s cookie settings – e.g., in Chrome, the user must allow third-party cookies for the domain to fix cross-domain authentication issues. Possibly also the user must recreate or reinitiate the connection after changing cookie settings.

Hence, the main point from the baseline is:
1. The likely reason is **blocked third-party cookies** from amazon.com to amazonaws.com, which breaks the SSO flow.
2. The fix is to **unblock those cookies** in your browser (e.g., via the cookie / site settings).
3. Then **delete and recreate** the connection in Query Editor V2 to pick up the new session.

- The chatbot attributes the issue to typical EKS node group style issues (or direct Redshift identity provider config issues like missing roles?), but doesn't highlight the possibility of blocked third-party cookies or the bridging from amazon.com to amazonaws.com. 
- The response focuses on standard misconfiguration or session mismatch reasons: user-to-role mapping, private networking, trust policies, etc. 
- The baseline specifically states the fix was to allow cross-domain cookies. 
**Rating**: **Unsatisfactory** (it’s not addressing that the real cause in the baseline was cookies blocked by the browser.)

### Completeness
- The baseline is about blocked cookies for the third-party domain. This response never addresses that. 
- Instead, it offers a wide range of standard checks (like checking the user’s roles in `SVV_IDENTITY_PROVIDER_ROLES`, verifying IAM role trust, etc.). 
**Rating**: **Unsatisfactory** (missing the baseline’s crucial mention of the cookie-blocking cause.)

### Clarity
- The suggestions themselves are structured well, but they do not reflect the baseline’s key fix. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

### Practicality
- The steps might help if the cause was misconfiguration, but not if the cause is the browser cookie issue. 
**Rating**: **Unsatisfactory** (the baseline solution is about unblocking cookies, which #1 doesn’t mention.)

**Overall Rating (Response #1)**: **Unsatisfactory**  
Completely omits the baseline’s main fix about unblocking cookies. Irrelevant to the baseline’s final root cause.

## Chatbot Response #2

### Accuracy
- They talk about potential partial solutions: IdC integration, network, roles, session management. 
- Again, it doesn’t reference the **cookie blocking** problem from the baseline. 
**Rating**: **Unsatisfactory** (the baseline is about unblocking third-party cookies, not these general config steps.)

### Completeness
- Fails to mention the possibility that the user’s browser is blocking cross-domain cookies. 
**Rating**: **Unsatisfactory**

### Clarity
- The content is coherent, but not aligned with the baseline cause. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

### Practicality
- Doesn’t solve the baseline’s cookie issue. 
**Rating**: **Unsatisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #2)**: **Unsatisfactory**  
No mention of the crucial cookie-blocking fix.

## Chatbot Response #3

### Accuracy
- It’s short or truncated, presumably offering no real solution? 
- Doesn’t mention the baseline’s cookie fix. 
**Rating**: **Unsatisfactory**

### Completeness
- Doesn’t discuss anything relevant. 
**Rating**: **Unsatisfactory**

### Clarity
- Possibly incomplete. 
**Rating**: **Unsatisfactory**

### Practicality
- No mention of the baseline solution. 
**Rating**: **Unsatisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #3)**: **Unsatisfactory**  
Doesn’t address the question at all.

## Chatbot Response #4

### Accuracy
- Mentions verifying IAM roles, trust policy, network settings, etc. 
- Like #1, #2, #4 is ignoring the baseline’s actual root cause that the user had to allow cross-domain cookies. 
**Rating**: **Unsatisfactory**  

### Completeness
- Doesn’t mention third-party cookie blocking. 
**Rating**: **Unsatisfactory**

### Clarity
- Well structured but not aligned with the baseline fix. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

### Practicality
- Doesn’t address the baseline’s actual solution. 
**Rating**: **Unsatisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #4)**: **Unsatisfactory**

---

## Chatbot Response #5

### Accuracy
- Goes in-depth about verifying the identity provider, roles, serverless concurrency, re-checking the config or contacting AWS Support. 
- Again, it doesn’t mention the possibility that the user’s browser is blocking cookies from different domains, which is the baseline’s actual fix. 
**Rating**: **Unsatisfactory**

### Completeness
- Misses the essential step of “unblock cookies.” 
**Rating**: **Unsatisfactory**

### Clarity
- Clear, but irrelevant to the baseline’s real solution. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

### Practicality
- Doesn’t solve the baseline’s problem. 
**Rating**: **Unsatisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #5)**: **Unsatisfactory**

# Summary of All Responses vs. Baseline

The baseline says: 
> The user discovered that blocking third-party cookies from `amazon.com` → `amazonaws.com` breaks the SSO flow. Once they unblocked those cookies, the error was resolved.

**All the chatbots** gave typical suggestions about role config, trust relationships, or contacting AWS Support for potential internal issues – **none** mentioned the actual root cause of the baseline (blocked cross-domain cookies in the browser). They are effectively ignoring the baseline’s solution or focusing on a different scenario. 

Hence:

**Accuracy**: All five fail to mention the cookie-blocking fix. They do not align with the baseline. 
**Completeness**: All are incomplete with respect to the baseline’s highlight about browser cookie settings. 
**Clarity**: They are fairly coherent, but not aligned with the baseline solution. 
**Practicality**: None addresses the real fix of allowing third-party cookies.

---

## Overall Best Response
All are missing the baseline’s actual solution. They focus on a different approach (typical role or config issues). Among them, none addresses the real cookie-based root cause. So none is correct with respect to the baseline. If we had to choose the best of the bunch on general grounds (like thoroughness about typical config fixes) we might pick **Chatbot #5** or #1, but they’re all equally ignoring the cookie-based solution. 

## Overall Worst Response
**Chatbot #3** provides the least content, presumably truncated. That is arguably the worst.

---

# Final Conclusion

None of the responses match the baseline’s emphasis on third-party cookie blocking as the cause. They all fail the baseline’s direct solution. However, they all provide general suggestions for typical Redshift-IdC integration issues rather than addressing the root cause from the baseline. 

**Best** (in general thoroughness, ignoring the baseline mismatch): Possibly **#5** or **#1**.  
**Worst**: **#3** (no meaningful solution).
