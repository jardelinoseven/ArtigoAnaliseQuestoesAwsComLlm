Elastic Beanstalk says 'aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role' does not exist when creating environment

## Highest-scored answer 

When creating an environment in eb, you need two roles (service and instance profile role). Apparently the instance profile role is not being created automatically. So you need to go to IAM and create a role called aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role with the following policies: AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier and AWSElasticBeanstalkMulticontainerDocker

   - Click on **Next: Tags** (you can skip adding tags).
   - Click on **Next: Review**.

3. **Name the Role**:
   - Name the role `aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role`.
   - Review the role and then click **Create role**.

4. **Create the Instance Profile**:
   - In the IAM console, click on **Roles**.
   - Find the role `aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role` you just created.
   - Click on the role name to open the role's details.
   - Click on the **Instance profile** tab.
   - If the instance profile doesn't exist, you need to create one:
     - Go to **Instance Profiles** under the IAM console (might be under "Roles" or a similar section).
     - Click on **Create Instance Profile**.
     - Name the instance profile `aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role`.
     - Attach the role `aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role` to the instance profile.

### Step 2: Assign the Role to Elastic Beanstalk Environment

It seems like the IAM instance profile `aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role` required by Elastic Beanstalk for creating instances is missing or not properly configured. Here are steps to resolve this issue:

1. **Check IAM Instance Profile**: 
   - Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM service.
   - Verify if the IAM instance profile named `aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role` exists. If it doesn't, you may need to create it.

2. **Create IAM Instance Profile**:
   - If the `aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role` instance profile is missing, create it by following these steps:
     - Go to the IAM service in the AWS Management Console.
     - Click on "Roles" in the left navigation pane.
     - Click on "Create role".
     - Select "AWS service" as the type of trusted entity.
     - Choose "Elastic Beanstalk" as the service that will use this role.
     - Attach policies as per your requirements (typically, Elastic Beanstalk service role permissions are provided by default policies).
     - Review and confirm the role creation.

3. **Ensure Correct Permissions**:
   - Make sure that the IAM instance profile `aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role` has the necessary permissions to perform actions required by Elastic Beanstalk, such as accessing S3 buckets, CloudWatch logs, and other resources.

4. **Update Elastic Beanstalk Environment**:
   - Once the IAM instance profile is created or updated with the required permissions, try creating the Elastic Beanstalk environment again.
   - Ensure that you select the correct IAM instance profile (`aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role`) during the environment creation process.

5. **Check Elastic Beanstalk Service Role**:
   - Additionally, verify that the Elastic Beanstalk service role has the necessary permissions. The service role is different from the instance profile and is used by Elastic Beanstalk to manage resources on your behalf.

6. **Review Elastic Beanstalk Configuration**:
   - Double-check the configuration settings for your Elastic Beanstalk environment to ensure that there are no misconfigurations or conflicts that could be causing the issue.

7. **Check AWS CLI or SDK Usage**:
   - If you are creating the Elastic Beanstalk environment using AWS CLI or SDK, ensure that you are specifying the correct instance profile (`aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role`) in your command or code.

By following these steps and ensuring that the IAM instance profile `aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role` is correctly configured and has the necessary permissions, you should be able to create the Elastic Beanstalk environment without encountering the error.

The error message "the instance profile aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role associated with the environment does not exist" indicates a missing required role for your Elastic Beanstalk environment. Here's how the AWS user can fix this issue:
Cause of the Issue:
In recent versions of AWS, Elastic Beanstalk no longer automatically creates an instance profile named "aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role" for new environments due to security best practices. This role is required to provide the necessary permissions for your application to run on EC2 instances.
Solution:
There are two ways to resolve this issue:
1. Create a New Instance Profile:
IAM Console: Navigate to the IAM service in the AWS Management Console.
Create Role: Click on "Roles" and then "Create Role."
EC2 Service: Under "Trusted entity type," choose "AWS service" and select "EC2" from the list. Click "Next."
Attach Policies: On the "Attach policy" page, select the following managed policies:
AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier (for web applications)
AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier (for background tasks)
AWSElasticBeanstalkMulticontainerDocker (for Docker containers)
Review and Create: Choose a name for the role, for example, "my-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role." Review the summary and click "Create role."
2. Use an Existing Instance Profile (if applicable):
If you already have an instance profile with the required permissions, you can use that profile instead of creating a new one.
Configuring Elastic Beanstalk Environment:
Once you have created an instance profile (method 1) or identified an existing one (method 2), return to Elastic Beanstalk environment creation.
In the environment configuration, under "Software" -> "Security," choose "Specify a custom instance profile" and select the name of the instance profile you created or identified in the previous steps.
Additional Notes:
Ensure the chosen instance profile has the necessary IAM policies attached to grant permissions for your application to run on EC2 instances.
Refer to the AWS documentation for more details on creating instance profiles and managing IAM permissions for Elastic Beanstalk: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html
By following these steps, the AWS user should be able to create an Elastic Beanstalk environment with the necessary instance profile permissions and avoid the "aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role does not exist" error.


## Q

To resolve the issue where Elastic Beanstalk is unable to find the 'aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role' instance profile, you can try the following:

1. Verify the IAM role:
   - Ensure that the 'aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role' IAM role exists in your AWS account. You can check this in the IAM console.
   - If the role does not exist, you can create it manually or use the Elastic Beanstalk console to create it automatically when you create a new environment.

2. Check the IAM role permissions:
   - Verify that the 'aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role' has the necessary permissions to perform the required actions for your Elastic Beanstalk environment.
   - You can review the managed policies attached to the role and ensure they provide the required permissions.

3. Update the IAM role:
   - If the 'aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role' exists but is missing the required permissions, you can update the role by attaching the necessary managed policies.
   - You can do this either through the IAM console or by using the AWS CLI:

   ```
   aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier
   aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSElasticBeanstalkMulticontainerDocker
   ```

4. Create a new Elastic Beanstalk environment:
   - If the issue persists, you can try creating a new Elastic Beanstalk environment. During the environment creation process, Elastic Beanstalk will automatically create the necessary IAM role if it doesn't already exist.

5. Check for any custom configurations:
   - Ensure that you are not using any custom configurations or settings that might be interfering with the default Elastic Beanstalk environment creation process.

If the issue still persists, you can refer to the AWS Elastic Beanstalk documentation for more detailed information on troubleshooting environment creation issues.
