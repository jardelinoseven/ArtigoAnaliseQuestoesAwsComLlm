Preventing Terraform from assigning reserved IP addresses to resources

I have a scenario where I’m using AWS server setup with an EFS and RDS setup. To enable high availability, I’ve configured a PCS cluster, and as a result, some IP addresses have been reserved as virtual IPs.
For deployment, I’m using a Terraform script. However, I’ve noticed that sometimes during deployments, Terraform automatically assigns these reserved IPs to some resources.
To illustrate, in this setup, the app servers are in a private subnet, and the RDS is also in this private subnet. Sometimes, Terraform assigns one of the IPs, which are reserved for app servers as Virtual IPs, to the RDS.
I want to prevent Terraform from assigning these reserved IPs to any other resource during deployment. What are the best practices or solutions to achieve this in Terraform?

Not sure how you "reserved" those virtual IPs, but the easy way is to define your private subnet CIDR range to avoid/exclude those virtual IPs. By doing this, you can make sure all resources created in this private subnet won't be assigned those "reserved" virtual IPs.

Furthermore, if you want, you can define private subnet for app servers and another database subnet for RDS to avoid IP conflicts in your case.

## Q

Thank you for sharing your issue with Terraform assigning reserved IP addresses to resources in your AWS environment. I understand this is causing problems with your high availability setup using a PCS cluster. Let's address this issue step by step.

To prevent Terraform from assigning reserved IP addresses to resources during deployment, you can implement the following solutions:

1. Use Explicit IP Address Assignment:
   - In your Terraform configuration, explicitly specify the IP addresses for your resources.
   - For RDS instances, you can use the `db_instance` resource and set the `private_ip` argument.
   - For EC2 instances, use the `network_interface` block within the `aws_instance` resource and set the `private_ips` argument.

2. Implement IP Address Exclusion:
   - Create a list of reserved IP addresses in your Terraform configuration.
   - Use Terraform's `cidrhost` function to generate a list of available IP addresses, excluding the reserved ones.
   - Assign IP addresses from this generated list to your resources.

3. Utilize Terraform Data Sources:
   - Use the `aws_network_interface` data source to query existing network interfaces and their IP addresses.
   - Implement logic to avoid using IP addresses that are already in use.

4. Implement Custom Validation Rules:
   - Use Terraform's `validation` block within resource configurations to add custom validation rules.
   - These rules can check if an IP address is in the list of reserved IPs before allowing its assignment.

5. Leverage Terraform's `null_resource`:
   - Use a `null_resource` with a `local-exec` provisioner to run a script that checks and validates IP assignments.
   - This script can fail the Terraform apply if it detects an attempt to use a reserved IP.

6. Use Terraform Workspaces:
   - Separate your infrastructure into different workspaces.
   - Manage the PCS cluster and its reserved IPs in one workspace, and other resources in another.
   - This separation can help prevent accidental IP conflicts.

To implement these solutions, you'll need to modify your Terraform scripts. Here's a general approach:

1. Create a list of reserved IPs:
   ```hcl
   variable "reserved_ips" {
     default = ["10.0.0.5", "10.0.0.6", "10.0.0.7"]
   }
   ```

2. Implement IP exclusion logic:
   ```hcl
   locals {
     available_ips = [for i in range(1, 255) : cidrhost("10.0.0.0/24", i) if !contains(var.reserved_ips, cidrhost("10.0.0.0/24", i))]
   }
   ```

3. Use the available IPs for your resources:
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_instance" "example" {
     # ... other configuration ...
     private_ip = local.available_ips[0]
   }
   ```

Remember to adjust the IP ranges and CIDR blocks according to your specific network configuration.

To verify that the problem has been solved:

1. Run `terraform plan` and carefully review the planned changes, ensuring no reserved IPs are being assigned.
2. After applying the changes, use the AWS Management Console or CLI to verify the IP assignments of your resources.
3. Test your PCS cluster functionality to ensure high availability is maintained.

If you continue to face issues after implementing these solutions, I recommend reaching out to AWS Support for more personalized assistance. They can provide guidance tailored to your specific environment and requirements.
