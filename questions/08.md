AWS ECS Task fails to provision due to EMPTY CAPACITY PROVIDER

I'm trying to run an ECS task in AWS using the EC2 launch type. This task has been running for almost a year without problems, but a few weeks ago it stopped working.


When I create a new task, it remains in "provisioning" until it fails. The error I'm getting is "TaskFailedToStart: EMPTY CAPACITY PROVIDER". I have been looking for answers but so far I have found nothing useful. Can anyone help with some ideas of what may be happening?

This is the autoscalling group configuration: [autoscalling config](https://i.sstatic.net/bKrvm.png)

## Baseline answer 

From the tests I ran, it looks like this could be caused by insufficient resources on the EC2 instance.

For example, if you use a t3.micro instance (2vCPU, 1 GB), but create a task with 1vCPU, 3 GB, this will fail.


## ChatGPT 4o

The **"TaskFailedToStart: EMPTY CAPACITY PROVIDER"** error in AWS **ECS (Elastic Container Service) with EC2 launch type** indicates that ECS **cannot find available EC2 instances** to run the task.

Your setup depends on **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)** to provision EC2 instances, but something is preventing new instances from being launched or recognized.

---

## **Possible Causes and Solutions**

### **1. Check if EC2 Instances are Running and Registered with ECS**
ECS tasks require **EC2 instances** that:
- Belong to the **correct cluster**.
- Have the **ECS agent running** and registered.

#### **How to Check?**
1. Run the following AWS CLI command:
   ```sh
   aws ecs list-container-instances --cluster your-cluster-name
   ```
   If no instances are listed, ECS does not have available hosts.

2. Check the **ECS instances in the AWS Console**:
   - **Go to ECS → Clusters → Your Cluster → ECS Instances**.
   - If the list is **empty**, ECS has no instances to schedule tasks.

✅ **Solution:**
- If no instances exist, check **Auto Scaling (ASG)** and manually start a new EC2 instance.
- Restart the ECS agent if needed:
  ```sh
  sudo systemctl restart ecs
  ```
- Verify that your instances are correctly associated with the cluster:
  ```sh
  cat /etc/ecs/ecs.config
  ```

---

### **2. Verify Auto Scaling Group (ASG) Status**
Your **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** should be automatically provisioning EC2 instances, but if **no instances are launching**, ECS cannot assign capacity.

#### **How to Check?**
1. **Go to AWS Console → EC2 → Auto Scaling Groups.**
2. Look at the **Desired Capacity, Min, and Max Instances** settings.
3. If **Desired Capacity is 0**, ECS will not have available instances.
4. Click on the **Activity History** tab to check for failed scaling events.

✅ **Solution:**
- Increase **Desired Capacity** manually:
  ```sh
  aws autoscaling set-desired-capacity --auto-scaling-group-name your-asg --desired-capacity 2
  ```
- Ensure there is **at least one active EC2 instance**.
- If no instances are launching, check **IAM roles, EC2 instance profile, or AWS service limits**.

---

### **3. Check Capacity Provider Configuration**
ECS uses **capacity providers** to determine where tasks can run. If your **capacity provider has no instances**, tasks will fail.

#### **How to Check?**
1. **Go to AWS Console → ECS → Your Cluster → Capacity Providers**.
2. If your **capacity provider has 0 instances**, ECS cannot place tasks.

✅ **Solution:**
- Ensure the **Auto Scaling Group is linked to ECS**.
- If needed, reconfigure the **capacity provider**:
  ```sh
  aws ecs update-capacity-provider --name your-capacity-provider --auto-scaling-group-provider "managedScaling={status=ENABLED}"
  ```

---

### **4. Validate EC2 Instance IAM Role**
ECS instances require the **AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role** IAM policy.

#### **How to Check?**
1. **Go to AWS Console → EC2 → Your Instances → IAM Role.**
2. If no IAM role is attached or it lacks **ECS permissions**, the instances won't register.

✅ **Solution:**
- Attach the correct IAM role:
  ```sh
  aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name ecsInstanceRole --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role
  ```

---

### **5. Restart ECS Agent on EC2 Instances**
If the ECS agent on existing instances is **not running**, they will **not be recognized by ECS**.

#### **How to Check?**
SSH into an existing ECS instance and run:
```sh
sudo systemctl status ecs
```
If it is **not running**, restart it:
```sh
sudo systemctl restart ecs
```

---

## **Final Checklist to Fix "EMPTY CAPACITY PROVIDER"**
| **Possible Cause** | **How to Check?** | **Solution** |
|---------------------|------------------|--------------|
| **No EC2 instances available in ECS cluster** | `aws ecs list-container-instances` | Start new instances, verify ECS registration |
| **Auto Scaling Group is not launching instances** | AWS Console → EC2 → Auto Scaling Groups | Increase desired capacity (`aws autoscaling set-desired-capacity`) |
| **Capacity Provider has no instances** | AWS Console → ECS → Capacity Providers | Ensure ASG is linked, reconfigure provider |
| **EC2 instances missing IAM Role** | AWS Console → EC2 → IAM Role | Attach `AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role` |
| **ECS Agent not running on EC2 instances** | `sudo systemctl status ecs` | Restart ECS agent (`sudo systemctl restart ecs`) |

### **Recommended Next Steps**
1. Manually start an EC2 instance and verify it registers with ECS.
2. Increase Auto Scaling Group's **Desired Capacity**.
3. Restart ECS agents on existing instances.
4. Verify IAM role and security groups.

This should resolve the issue. Let me know if you need further clarification! 🚀


## Gemini

The "TaskFailedToStart: EMPTY CAPACITY PROVIDER" error in AWS ECS, especially when using EC2 launch type, indicates that ECS cannot find or utilize the EC2 instances it needs to run your task. This usually stems from issues with your Capacity Provider, Auto Scaling Group, or EC2 instance availability.

Here's a breakdown of potential causes and solutions:

**1. Capacity Provider Configuration:**

* **Verify Capacity Provider Association:**
    * Ensure your ECS service or task definition is correctly associated with the Capacity Provider that utilizes your Auto Scaling Group.
    * Double-check the Capacity Provider configuration within your ECS cluster.
* **Check Capacity Provider Status:**
    * In the ECS console, examine the status of your Capacity Provider. It should be "ACTIVE."
* **Capacity Provider Strategy:**
    * Review the Capacity Provider strategy for your service or task. Ensure it's configured to use your intended Capacity Provider.

**2. Auto Scaling Group (ASG) Issues:**

* **ASG Health Checks:**
    * The most likely culprit is that your ASG health checks are failing. This prevents ECS from registering instances from the ASG.
    * Check your ASG's health check settings. Are they configured correctly? Are your EC2 instances passing the health checks?
    * Verify that the health check type is set correctly, and that the health check grace period is sufficient.
* **ASG Instance Types:**
    * Confirm that the instance types defined in your ASG's launch template or launch configuration are available in your region.
    * AWS sometimes retires older instance types, or availability can be limited.
* **ASG Desired Capacity:**
    * Ensure that your ASG's desired capacity is greater than 0. If it's 0, ECS won't be able to launch any tasks.
* **ASG Launch Template/Configuration:**
    * Review the launch template or launch configuration for your ASG. Ensure that the following are correctly set:
        * Security groups: Allow necessary inbound and outbound traffic.
        * IAM role: The EC2 instances must have an IAM role that allows them to register with ECS.
        * User data: If you're using user data to configure your instances, ensure that it's not causing any errors.
* **Subnet Availability:**
    * Make sure that the subnets that the ASG is configured to launch instances into have available IP addresses.
    * Confirm that the subnets are associated with a route table that allows outbound internet access or access to other AWS services.
* **ASG scaling policies:**
    * If the ASG relies on scaling policies, verify that the policies are working correctly.

**3. EC2 Instance Issues:**

* **Instance State:**
    * If your ASG has launched instances, check their state. Are they running? Are they in a healthy state?
* **ECS Agent:**
    * Ensure that the ECS agent is running on your EC2 instances. If it's not, ECS won't be able to register the instances.
    * Check the ECS agent logs on the EC2 instances.
* **Resource Limits:**
    * Check your EC2 instance resource limits (CPU, memory). If they're exhausted, your tasks may not be able to start.
* **Security Group Rules:**
    * Verify that the security group rules applied to the EC2 instances permit the necessary inbound and outbound traffic for the ECS agent and your application.
* **IAM Role:**
    * Verify that the IAM role that the EC2 instances are using has the required permissions to communicate with ECS.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1.  **Check ASG Health:**
    * Go to the EC2 console and examine your ASG. Pay close attention to the instance health status and any error messages.
2.  **Inspect EC2 Instances:**
    * If you have running EC2 instances, connect to them and check the ECS agent logs.
3.  **Review Capacity Provider:**
    * In the ECS console, verify the configuration and status of your Capacity Provider.
4.  **Check CloudWatch Logs:**
    * Review CloudWatch logs for ECS and EC2 for any error messages.
5.  **Simplify:**
    * Create a very basic task definition, and try to launch it. This will help to determine if the issue is with the specific task definition, or with the infrastructure.
6.  **Verify IAM Role:**
    * Ensure the ECS instance role has the required permissions.

By systematically going through these steps, you should be able to pinpoint the root cause of the "EMPTY CAPACITY PROVIDER" error and get your ECS tasks running again.



## Q

Based on the issue you've described, it appears that your ECS task is failing to start due to an empty capacity provider. This error suggests that there are no available EC2 instances in your ECS cluster to run the task. Let's go through some potential solutions to address this issue:

1. Check your Auto Scaling Group (ASG) configuration:
   - Ensure that the ASG associated with your ECS cluster is properly configured.
   - Verify that the desired capacity, minimum capacity, and maximum capacity settings are appropriate for your workload.
   - Check if there are any scaling policies in place and if they're functioning correctly.

2. Verify EC2 instance health:
   - Check if the EC2 instances in your ASG are healthy and running.
   - Look for any terminated or unhealthy instances that might be causing capacity issues.

3. Review ECS Capacity Provider settings:
   - Ensure that your ECS cluster has a properly configured capacity provider.
   - Verify that the capacity provider is linked to the correct Auto Scaling Group.

4. Check ECS Agent status:
   - If instances are running but not registering with the ECS cluster, check the ECS agent logs on the instances.
   - Ensure the ECS agent is running and properly configured to join your cluster.

5. Examine IAM roles and permissions:
   - Verify that the EC2 instances have the correct IAM role attached, allowing them to communicate with ECS.
   - Ensure the ECS service role has the necessary permissions to manage EC2 instances and Auto Scaling groups.

6. Review network configuration:
   - Check that the VPC, subnets, and security groups are correctly configured to allow communication between ECS and your EC2 instances.

7. Investigate recent changes:
   - Since this task was running fine for almost a year, consider any recent changes to your AWS environment that might have affected the ECS cluster or EC2 instances.

8. Monitor CloudWatch metrics:
   - Look at ECS CloudWatch metrics to see if there are any unusual patterns in resource utilization or task placement failures.

To verify if the problem has been solved:

1. Attempt to run the task again after making any necessary changes.
2. Monitor the task status in the ECS console or using the AWS CLI.
3. Check the Events tab in the ECS console for your cluster and service to see if there are any new error messages.

If the issue persists after trying these solutions, I recommend gathering more detailed logs and contacting AWS Support for further assistance. They can provide more specific guidance based on your account and configuration details.

## DeepSeek R1

To resolve the **ECS Task "EMPTY CAPACITY PROVIDER" error**, follow these steps:

---

### **1. Verify Capacity Provider Configuration**
- **EC2 Launch Type**: Ensure your ECS service/task is **not using a Capacity Provider Strategy** (meant for Fargate).  
  - Go to **ECS Cluster → Service → Update Service → Deployment Configuration** → Set **Capacity provider strategy** to `DISABLED`.  
  - For EC2 launch type, rely on the **EC2 instances in your Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** instead of capacity providers.

---

### **2. Check Auto Scaling Group (ASG) Health**
1. **Instance Status**:  
   - In the AWS Console, navigate to **EC2 → Auto Scaling Groups → [Your ASG]**.  
   - Confirm instances are in **`InService`** state.  
   - If **Desired Capacity** is `0`, increase it to `1`+ and wait for instances to launch.  
2. **Scaling Policies**:  
   - Ensure scaling policies (e.g., CPU/memory thresholds) aren’t terminating instances prematurely.  

---

### **3. Validate ECS Cluster Registration**
- **ECS Agent**: EC2 instances in the ASG must have the **ECS Agent** running and registered to your cluster.  
  - Check instance **User Data** to ensure it includes the ECS registration command:  
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "ECS_CLUSTER=your-cluster-name" >> /etc/ecs/ecs.config
    ```
  - **SSH into an instance** and verify:  
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:51678/v1/metadata | grep ClusterName
    ```

---

### **4. Reattach ASG to ECS Capacity Provider**
If you use a capacity provider (optional for EC2 launch type):  
1. **Delete & Recreate the Capacity Provider**:  
   - Navigate to **ECS → Capacity Providers → Delete** the misconfigured provider.  
   - Recreate it, linking it to your ASG:  
     ```bash
     aws ecs create-capacity-provider \
       --name my-ec2-capacity-provider \
       --auto-scaling-group-provider autoScalingGroupArn="arn:aws:autoscaling:region:account-id:autoScalingGroup:asg-id",managedTerminationProtection="DISABLED"
     ```
2. **Update the ECS Service**:  
   - Associate the new capacity provider with your service.

---

### **5. Fix Launch Configuration/Template**
- **Outdated AMI**: Ensure the ASG’s launch template uses an **ECS-optimized AMI** (e.g., `ami-0abcdef1234567890` for your region).  
- **IAM Role**: The EC2 instances must have an IAM role with the **`AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role`** policy.  

---

### **6. Check Networking & Security Groups**
- **Security Groups**: Ensure instances allow inbound/outbound traffic to ECS endpoints (port `443` for ECS API).  
- **Subnets**: Verify the ASG deploys instances to subnets with **route tables** and **NACLs** allowing ECS communication.  

---

### **7. Restart ECS Agent**
On existing EC2 instances:  
```bash
sudo systemctl restart ecs
```

---

### **8. Recreate the ECS Service**
If misconfigured, delete and redeploy the service:  
```bash
aws ecs delete-service --cluster your-cluster --service your-service --force
aws ecs create-service --cluster your-cluster --service-name your-service ...
```

---

### **Common Causes**
- **ASG Scaling to Zero**: Misconfigured scaling policies or health checks.  
- **Capacity Provider Mismatch**: ECS service uses a deleted/misconfigured capacity provider.  
- **Failed ECS Agent**: Instances can’t register with the cluster.  

---

### **Final Checks**
1. **ECS Events Tab**: Check for errors like `No Container Instances Found`.  
2. **Instance Status Checks**: In EC2, confirm instances pass both **Status Checks**.  
3. **Task Definition**: Ensure it’s compatible with EC2 (not Fargate-specific).  

By aligning ASG/ECS configurations and validating instance health, the task should provision successfully.

## ChatGPT-o1

Below are some common reasons why ECS tasks fail to start with a “TaskFailedToStart: EMPTY CAPACITY PROVIDER” error when using the EC2 launch type, plus suggested ways to fix them. In short, if ECS sees no matching (healthy) container instances in your capacity provider’s Auto Scaling Group (ASG), or the instances are all drained/unavailable, you’ll get “EMPTY CAPACITY PROVIDER.”

---

## 1. Auto Scaling Group Not Spinning Up Instances

**Symptoms/Signs:**
- The cluster’s EC2 Instances page is empty or only has drained / unhealthy instances.
- The ASG is scaled down to zero or stuck in pending launch states.

**Solutions / Checks:**
1. **Verify the desired capacity** in the ASG is at least 1 (or more if you need more tasks).  
2. **Check scaling policies** to ensure they aren’t stuck at zero or failing to trigger.  
3. If you recently changed the instance type or launch template, confirm there’s no “InsufficientInstanceCapacity” error in the EC2 console logs.  
4. Look at the **EC2 console** for newly launched instances to see if they exist but are stuck in an error state.

---

## 2. Instances Not Registering to ECS (User Data or IAM Issues)

Even if the ASG is launching instances, they must successfully join the ECS cluster:

**What to check:**
1. **ECS Agent**: Make sure your AMI or user data script starts the ECS agent with the correct cluster name. For example, in the user data:
   ```bash
   echo "ECS_CLUSTER=your-cluster-name" >> /etc/ecs/ecs.config
   ```
2. **IAM Role**: The instance profile attached to your ECS container instances must have `AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role` or an equivalent policy. If that’s missing or changed, the agent can’t register.  
3. **ECS Logs**: In the instance’s `/var/log/ecs/ecs-agent.log`, watch for errors. If the agent can’t connect or register, you won’t see the instance in the ECS cluster.

---

## 3. Capacity Provider or Cluster Misconfiguration

**Possible pitfalls:**
1. **Wrong capacity provider**: The cluster or service might point to a capacity provider that is no longer valid (e.g., you changed the ASG name or region).  
2. **Capacity provider not attached**: If you created a new ASG or changed your cluster name, you might need to re-create or re-attach the capacity provider in the ECS console.  
3. **Managed Scaling / Managed Termination**: If you enabled ECS Managed Scaling, confirm that it hasn’t forcibly scaled your ASG to zero for some reason. Double-check those settings.

---

## 4. Instances in a Draining State

If the ECS cluster shows container instances but they’re all in a “DRAINING” state, new tasks can’t launch on them.

**Solution:**  
- Mark those instances as “ACTIVE” again in the ECS console or re-launch them so that the ECS scheduler can place tasks on them.

---

## 5. Out-of-Date Launch Template or AMI

If the underlying AMI or Launch Template for your ASG is out of date, new instances might fail to start or register:

**Check:**
1. If the AMI was replaced or removed from your account.  
2. If a newly introduced policy or network config is preventing the instance from starting.  
3. If the ECS-optimized AMI ID is no longer valid for your region or instance type.

---

## 6. Subnet or AZ Capacity Issues

If your ASG is pinned to a specific subnet or availability zone that has no capacity for that instance type, you can get stuck provisioning.

**Check:**
1. The subnets in your ASG and that they have capacity for the instance type.  
2. Try adding subnets across multiple AZs in your region so the ASG can pick an AZ with available capacity.

---

### Summary

To resolve the “EMPTY CAPACITY PROVIDER” error, confirm that:
1. **At least one EC2 instance** is running and active in your ECS cluster.  
2. Your ASG’s **desired capacity** is above zero and it’s actually launching instances.  
3. The launched instances **successfully register** to the ECS cluster (correct user data, IAM role, ECS agent).  
4. Your ECS cluster or service is referencing the **right capacity provider** that ties to your ASG.  
5. The instances are in **ACTIVE** state and not draining.  

Once you ensure there are healthy container instances available in the capacity provider’s ASG, new tasks will be able to transition out of “PROVISIONING” and into “RUNNING.”


## Analysis 

Note: The five LLMs have been anonymized in the analysis below, as follows: ChatGPT-4o is Chatbot #1, Gemini 2.0 Flash is Chatbot #2, Q is Chatbot #3, DeepSeek R1 is Chatbot #4 and ChatGPT-o1 is Chatbot #5

Below is a detailed evaluation of each chatbot response, comparing them to the **baseline answer** from Stack Overflow. The **baseline** states:

> From the tests I ran, it looks like this could be caused by insufficient resources on the EC2 instance.  
>  
> For example, if you use a t3.micro instance (2vCPU, 1 GB), but create a task with 1vCPU, 3 GB, this will fail.

Thus, the baseline’s central point is that the **“EMPTY CAPACITY PROVIDER”** (or more generally, a failure to place tasks) might be caused by **insufficient ECS cluster resources** (e.g., the container instance does not meet the CPU/memory requirements).

### 3. Clarity
- Good structure with bullet points.  
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

### 4. Practicality
- Provides straightforward solutions (increasing desired capacity, verifying user data, checking if instances are draining).  
- The user might not realize from this alone that you could be using a small instance for a large task.  
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #5)**: **Partially Satisfactory**

---

# Summary of Evaluations

## Accuracy
- All five chatbots mention general ECS capacity or auto scaling issues as the cause for “EMPTY CAPACITY PROVIDER.”  
- **Response #2** specifically includes checking resource limits (CPU/memory) on the instance. That directly aligns with the baseline example (inadequate memory causes tasks to fail).  

## Completeness
- None of them references the baseline’s explicit example scenario (1 vCPU, 3 GB tasks on a small T3.micro with 1 GB).  
- **Response #2** is the only one that explicitly calls out “Check your EC2 instance resource limits (CPU, memory) … If they’re exhausted, your tasks may not start,” which is close to the baseline.  

## Clarity
- All are well-structured. #1 uses a final checklist, #2 is also well organized, #3, #4, #5 are similarly bullet-based and fairly clear.  

## Practicality
- All provide decent, real-world debugging steps.  
- Only #2 directly addresses “resource exhaustion,” which the baseline states is often the culprit.  

---

# Overall Best Response
Because the baseline’s central takeaway is “the instance might be too small for your task,” the only chatbot response explicitly saying “Check your EC2 instance resource limits (CPU, memory). If they’re exhausted, your tasks may not be able to start” is:

- **Chatbot #2** – It alone aligns with the baseline’s specific mention that “if your instance is too small for the requested resources, it will fail.”  

Hence, **Response #2** is the best match with the baseline’s main message.

# Overall Worst Response
They’re all reasonably correct about capacity/ASG issues, but which is worst from the perspective of ignoring the baseline’s “insufficient resource” cause?

- **All** but #2 do not mention resource constraints at all. Among them, none is factually incorrect, but #3 provides the broadest approach without referencing resource constraints.  
- Possibly **Response #3** is the least direct about this baseline scenario. It’s quite general and never says “insufficient memory/CPU.”

Hence, **Response #3** is the worst alignment with the baseline – it never addresses the instance might be too small for the configured task resources.

## Final Answer

**Accuracy**  
- #2 explicitly mentions CPU/memory constraints, others do not.

**Completeness**  
- #2 covers resource constraints more fully; the rest omit the baseline’s main point.

**Clarity**  
- All are fairly clear in structure.

**Practicality**  
- #2 best matches the baseline’s real-world cause (insufficient memory/CPU).

**Overall Best Response**: **Chatbot #2**  
**Overall Worst Response**: **Chatbot #3**
