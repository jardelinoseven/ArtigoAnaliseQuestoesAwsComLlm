AWS ECS Task fails to provision due to EMPTY CAPACITY PROVIDER

I'm trying to run an ECS task in AWS using the EC2 launch type. This task has been running for almost a year without problems, but a few weeks ago it stopped working.


When I create a new task, it remains in "provisioning" until it fails. The error I'm getting is "TaskFailedToStart: EMPTY CAPACITY PROVIDER". I have been looking for answers but so far I have found nothing useful. Can anyone help with some ideas of what may be happening?

## Highest-scored answer 

From the tests I ran, it looks like this could be caused by insufficient resources on the EC2 instance.

For example, if you use a t3.micro instance (2vCPU, 1 GB), but create a task with 1vCPU, 3 GB, this will fail.

## Q

Based on the issue you've described, it appears that your ECS task is failing to start due to an empty capacity provider. This error suggests that there are no available EC2 instances in your ECS cluster to run the task. Let's go through some potential solutions to address this issue:

1. Check your Auto Scaling Group (ASG) configuration:
   - Ensure that the ASG associated with your ECS cluster is properly configured.
   - Verify that the desired capacity, minimum capacity, and maximum capacity settings are appropriate for your workload.
   - Check if there are any scaling policies in place and if they're functioning correctly.

2. Verify EC2 instance health:
   - Check if the EC2 instances in your ASG are healthy and running.
   - Look for any terminated or unhealthy instances that might be causing capacity issues.

3. Review ECS Capacity Provider settings:
   - Ensure that your ECS cluster has a properly configured capacity provider.
   - Verify that the capacity provider is linked to the correct Auto Scaling Group.

4. Check ECS Agent status:
   - If instances are running but not registering with the ECS cluster, check the ECS agent logs on the instances.
   - Ensure the ECS agent is running and properly configured to join your cluster.

5. Examine IAM roles and permissions:
   - Verify that the EC2 instances have the correct IAM role attached, allowing them to communicate with ECS.
   - Ensure the ECS service role has the necessary permissions to manage EC2 instances and Auto Scaling groups.

6. Review network configuration:
   - Check that the VPC, subnets, and security groups are correctly configured to allow communication between ECS and your EC2 instances.

7. Investigate recent changes:
   - Since this task was running fine for almost a year, consider any recent changes to your AWS environment that might have affected the ECS cluster or EC2 instances.

8. Monitor CloudWatch metrics:
   - Look at ECS CloudWatch metrics to see if there are any unusual patterns in resource utilization or task placement failures.

To verify if the problem has been solved:

1. Attempt to run the task again after making any necessary changes.
2. Monitor the task status in the ECS console or using the AWS CLI.
3. Check the Events tab in the ECS console for your cluster and service to see if there are any new error messages.

If the issue persists after trying these solutions, I recommend gathering more detailed logs and contacting AWS Support for further assistance. They can provide more specific guidance based on your account and configuration details.
