We are using Azure DevOps default agents for pipeline runs.
i also tried to update the task to 2 but its not working.

Pls any one have the information, let me know.




## Baseline answer 

@brucewayne

The warning error you are seeing is a known issue with the [AWS Toolkit for Azure DevOps extension][1] and you can follow discussions: [ECRPushImage warning in Azure Devops due to Node10 dependency][2]

> ##[warning]Task 'Amazon ECR Push' version 1 (ECRPushImage@1) is dependent on a Node version (10) that is end-of-life. Contact the extension owner for an updated version of the task. Task maintainers should review Node upgrade guidance: https://aka.ms/node-runner-guidance


If this becomes a significant problem, consider using alternative tasks, such as Bash@3 and Docker@2 and avoid using tasks from the extension, while this is been fixed.

I have tried a simple pipeline with Docker task: 
The full yaml file is here: https://github.com/iheanacho-chukwu/aks-hellowebapi/blob/deploy-to-ecr/docker-task-aws.yml

```yaml
- script: |
    echo "Logging in to AWS ECR"
    aws ecr get-login-password --region $(AWS_REGION) | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $(AWS_ACCOUNT_ID).dkr.ecr.$(AWS_REGION).amazonaws.com
  displayName: 'Login to AWS'
  env:
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: $(AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID)
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: $(AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)

- task: Docker@2
  displayName: Build and Push Docker Image
  inputs:
    repository: $(DOCKER_REPOSITORY)
    command: buildAndPush
    Dockerfile: Dockerfile
    tags: |
      $(TAG)
```

[![enter image description here][3]][3]
another one using entirely bash: https://github.com/iheanacho-chukwu/aks-hellowebapi/blob/deploy-to-ecr/push-docker-image-ecr-using-bash.yml

```yaml
- script: |
    echo "Logging in to AWS ECR"
    aws ecr get-login-password --region $(AWS_REGION) | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $(AWS_ACCOUNT_ID).dkr.ecr.$(AWS_REGION).amazonaws.com
  displayName: 'Login to AWS'
  env:
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: $(AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID)
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: $(AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)

- script: |
    docker build -t $(DOCKER_REPOSITORY):$(TAG) .
    docker tag $(DOCKER_REPOSITORY):$(TAG) $(AWS_ACCOUNT_ID).dkr.ecr.$(AWS_REGION).amazonaws.com/$(DOCKER_REPOSITORY_NAME):$(TAG)
    docker push $(AWS_ACCOUNT_ID).dkr.ecr.$(AWS_REGION).amazonaws.com/$(DOCKER_REPOSITORY_NAME):$(TAG)
  displayName: 'Build and Push Docker Image using Bash Script'
  env:
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: $(AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID)
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: $(AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
```

I passed my AWS credential as [Azure DevOps variable group][4], so I dont have to hardcode to repo.

## ChatGPT 4o

### **Fixing "AWS Shell Script" and "Amazon ECR Push" Node 10 Deprecation Warning in Azure DevOps**

Your **Azure DevOps Pipeline** is showing warnings related to **deprecated Node.js version 10**, which is no longer supported. The tasks affected are:

1. **AWS Shell Script** (`AWSShellScript@1`)
2. **Amazon ECR Push** (`ECRPushImage@1`)

Since Azure DevOps **removed support for Node 10** in pipeline tasks, you need to migrate to **newer versions of these tasks**.

---

## **Solution 1: Upgrade to Latest Task Versions**
Your pipeline currently uses **Version 1** (`AWSShellScript@1` and `ECRPushImage@1`), which depends on **Node.js 10**. Upgrading to **Version 2** or newer may fix this issue.

### **Update Your Pipeline Task Versions**
Modify your pipeline YAML to use the latest versions:

```yaml
- task: AWSShellScript@2  # Upgrade from @1 to @2
  displayName: Docker build ${{ appService.name }}
  inputs:
    regionName: '${{ parameters.ecrRegion }}'
    scriptType: 'inline'
    inlineScript: |
      aws ecr get-login-password --region ${{ parameters.ecrRegion }} | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $(ecrURL)
      echo -e "FROM ${{ parameters.openJDKImage }} \nRUN mkdir /artifact && apk add openssl \nCOPY ${{ appService.name }}-$(JAR_SNAPSHOT_VERSION).jar /artifact/service.jar \nCMD [\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"java -jar /artifact/service.jar\"]" > Dockerfile | docker build . -t $(ecrURL)/${{ appService.ecrRepo }}:$(VERSION)-$(COMMIT)
    disableAutoCwd: true
    workingDirectory: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)'

- task: ECRPushImage@2  # Upgrade from @1 to @2
  displayName: Push ${{ appService.name }} image to DEV ECR
  inputs:
    regionName: '${{ parameters.ecrRegion }}'
    sourceImageName: '$(ecrURL)/${{ appService.ecrRepo }}'
    sourceImageTag: '$(VERSION)-$(COMMIT)'
    repositoryName: '${{ appService.ecrRepo }}'
    pushTag: '$(VERSION)-$(COMMIT)'
    outputVariable: '$(ecrURL)/${{ appService.ecrRepo }}:$(VERSION)-$(COMMIT)'
```

✅ **Why?**
- **`AWSShellScript@2` and `ECRPushImage@2`** use **newer Node.js versions** (>=14), resolving the warning.
- Ensures **compatibility with Azure DevOps default agents**.

---

## **Solution 2: Use AWS CLI Instead of AWSShellScript**
If upgrading the task version does not work, replace **`AWSShellScript@1`** with a standard **Azure CLI Bash script**.

### **Replace `AWSShellScript` with `Bash`**
```yaml
- task: Bash@3
  displayName: Docker build ${{ appService.name }}
  inputs:
    targetType: 'inline'
    script: |
      aws ecr get-login-password --region ${{ parameters.ecrRegion }} | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $(ecrURL)
      echo -e "FROM ${{ parameters.openJDKImage }} \nRUN mkdir /artifact && apk add openssl \nCOPY ${{ appService.name }}-$(JAR_SNAPSHOT_VERSION).jar /artifact/service.jar \nCMD [\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"java -jar /artifact/service.jar\"]" > Dockerfile | docker build . -t $(ecrURL)/${{ appService.ecrRepo }}:$(VERSION)-$(COMMIT)
```

✅ **Why?**
- `Bash@3` runs in **modern environments** without relying on **deprecated AWS tasks**.
- Uses **AWS CLI directly**, ensuring long-term support.

---

## **Solution 3: Use AWS Toolkit for Azure DevOps**
Instead of `AWSShellScript`, use **AWS Toolkit for Azure DevOps** which is **actively maintained**.

### **Install AWS Toolkit**
1. Open **Azure DevOps → Extensions Marketplace**.
2. Search for **AWS Toolkit for Azure DevOps**.
3. Install it for your organization.
4. Use `AWSCLI@1` instead of `AWSShellScript@1`:

```yaml
- task: AWSCLI@1
  displayName: Login to ECR
  inputs:
    awsCredentials: 'AWS Service Connection'
    regionName: '${{ parameters.ecrRegion }}'
    command: 'ecr get-login-password'
    arguments: '--region ${{ parameters.ecrRegion }} | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $(ecrURL)'
```

✅ **Why?**
- The **AWS CLI task (`AWSCLI@1`) is updated regularly**.
- Avoids **deprecated Node.js dependencies**.

---

## **Final Recommendation**
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Deprecated Node.js 10 warning** | Upgrade tasks to `AWSShellScript@2` & `ECRPushImage@2` |
| **Pipeline still fails with v2** | Replace `AWSShellScript` with `Bash@3` |
| **Best long-term solution** | Use `AWSCLI@1` (AWS Toolkit for Azure DevOps) |

After applying these fixes, your **Azure DevOps pipeline should run without warnings** and remain **future-proof**! 🚀 Let me know if you need further debugging! ✅

## Gemini

The core issue is that the Azure DevOps tasks `AWSShellScript@1` and `ECRPushImage@1` are dependent on Node.js version 10, which has reached its end-of-life. This means the tasks are using an outdated runtime and might have security vulnerabilities or compatibility issues.

Here's a breakdown of the problem and the solutions:

**Understanding the Problem:**

* **End-of-Life Node.js:**
    * Node.js 10 is no longer supported, meaning it doesn't receive security updates or bug fixes.
    * Using outdated runtimes in your pipelines can introduce security risks.
* **Task Dependencies:**
    * The Azure DevOps tasks you're using rely on Node.js 10, which is why you're seeing the warnings.
* **Azure DevOps Agents:**
    * Even when using Microsoft hosted agents, the underlying tasks need to be updated by the task owners.
* **Task Version:**
    * The user mentioned trying to update the task to version 2, but it did not solve the issue. This strongly points to the tasks themselves needing an update by the task owner.

**Solutions:**

1.  **Update the Tasks (Preferred):**

    * The ideal solution is for the task owners (AWS or the community contributors who maintain these tasks) to update them to use a supported Node.js version.
    * **Contact the Task Owners:**
        * Reach out to the maintainers of the `AWSShellScript` and `ECRPushImage` tasks through the Azure DevOps Marketplace or their respective GitHub repositories (if available).
        * Inform them about the Node.js 10 dependency and request an update.
    * **Check for Updates:**
        * Regularly check the Azure DevOps Marketplace for updates to these tasks.
        * It is possible that an update has been released, but the user has not yet obtained it.

2.  **Use Alternative Tasks or Scripts:**

    * If the tasks are not updated, consider using alternative tasks or scripts that don't rely on Node.js 10.
    * **AWS CLI Directly:**
        * Replace the `AWSShellScript` task with a standard "Bash" or "PowerShell" task and execute the AWS CLI commands directly.
        * Example replacing the first AWSShellScript task with a bash task.
            ```yaml
            - bash: |
                aws ecr get-login-password --region ${{ parameters.ecrRegion }}| docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $(ecrURL)
                echo -e "FROM ${{ parameters.openJDKImage }} \nRUN mkdir /artifact && apk add openssl \nCOPY ${{ appService.name }}-$(JAR_SNAPSHOT_VERSION).jar /artifact/service.jar \nCMD [\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"java -jar /artifact/service.jar\"]" > Dockerfile | docker build . -t $(ecrURL)/${{ appService.ecrRepo }}:$(VERSION)-$(COMMIT)
              displayName: Docker build ${{ appService.name }}
              workingDirectory: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)'
            ```
    * **Docker Task:**
        * Replace the ECRPushImage task with the standard docker task.
        * Example replacing the ECRPushImage task with a Docker task.
            ```yaml
            - task: Docker@2
              displayName: Push ${{ appService.name }} image to DEV ECR
              inputs:
                containerRegistry: 'ecrURL'
                repository: '${{ appService.ecrRepo }}'
                command: 'push'
                tags: '$(VERSION)-$(COMMIT)'
            ```

3.  **Self-Hosted Agents (Temporary Workaround):**

    * As a temporary workaround, you could use self-hosted agents with Node.js 10 installed.
    * However, this is not a long-term solution, as you would still be using an outdated runtime.
    * It is also not an ideal solution, as it requires extra work to maintain the self hosted agents.

**Key Improvements:**

* **Security:**
    * Using supported runtimes is crucial for maintaining the security of your pipelines.
* **Compatibility:**
    * Updating tasks or using alternatives ensures compatibility with future Azure DevOps updates.
* **Maintainability:**
    * Using standard tasks or scripts makes your pipelines more maintainable and less dependent on third-party extensions.

**Recommendation:**

* Prioritize contacting the task owners and requesting updates.
* In the meantime, use the alternative tasks or scripts provided above to mitigate the security risks.

By following these steps, you can address the Node.js 10 dependency and ensure the security and stability of your Azure DevOps pipelines.

To resolve the Node.js 10 dependency warnings in your Azure DevOps pipeline, follow these steps:

### 1. **Replace Deprecated AWS Tasks with Modern Alternatives**
Avoid using `AWSShellScript@1` and `ECRPushImage@1` (both use legacy Node.js 10). Use Azure's native Docker tasks and AWS CLI commands instead:

```yaml
steps:
- task: Docker@2
  displayName: Build and Push to ECR
  inputs:
    containerRegistry: $(ecrConnectionName)  # Create an AWS ECR service connection first
    repository: ${{ appService.ecrRepo }}
    command: buildAndPush
    Dockerfile: Dockerfile
    buildContext: $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)
    tags: |
      $(VERSION)-$(COMMIT)
```

### 2. **Use Generic Script Tasks for AWS CLI Operations**
Replace `AWSShellScript@1` with Azure's built-in Bash/PowerShell tasks:

```yaml
- bash: |
    # Login to ECR
    aws ecr get-login-password --region ${{ parameters.ecrRegion }} | \
    docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $(ecrURL)
    
    # Build Docker image
    docker build -t $(ecrURL)/${{ appService.ecrRepo }}:$(VERSION)-$(COMMIT) .
  displayName: Build Docker Image
  workingDirectory: $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)
```

### 3. **Create an AWS ECR Service Connection**
1. Go to **Project Settings → Service Connections → New Service Connection → AWS**
2. Configure with your AWS credentials
3. Reference it in your pipeline using the connection name

### 4. **Update Pipeline Agent Configuration**
Ensure your agent uses a modern Node.js version. Add this step before your tasks:

```yaml
- task: NodeTool@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '18.x'  # Use LTS version
  displayName: Install Node.js
```

### Key Changes Explained:
| Old Task | New Approach | Benefit |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| `AWSShellScript@1` | Native Bash/PowerShell tasks | Avoid Node.js 10 dependency |
| `ECRPushImage@1` | Azure Docker Task v2 | Modern Docker integration |
| Manual AWS CLI calls | Service connections | Secure credential management |

### Full Updated Pipeline Example:
```yaml
variables:
  ecrURL: <your-ecr-url>
  ecrConnectionName: 'aws-ecr-connection'

steps:
- task: NodeTool@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '18.x'
  displayName: 'Install Node.js'

- bash: |
    aws configure set region ${{ parameters.ecrRegion }}
    aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $(ecrURL)
    
    # Generate Dockerfile
    echo -e "FROM ${{ parameters.openJDKImage }}\nRUN mkdir /artifact && apk add openssl\nCOPY ${{ appService.name }}-$(JAR_SNAPSHOT_VERSION).jar /artifact/service.jar\nCMD [\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"java -jar /artifact/service.jar\"]" > Dockerfile
    
    docker build -t $(ecrURL)/${{ appService.ecrRepo }}:$(VERSION)-$(COMMIT) .
  displayName: Build Docker Image
  workingDirectory: $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)

- task: Docker@2
  displayName: Push to ECR
  inputs:
    command: push
    containerRegistry: $(ecrConnectionName)
    repository: ${{ appService.ecrRepo }}
    tags: |
      $(VERSION)-$(COMMIT)
```

This approach:
1. Eliminates Node.js 10 warnings
2. Uses Azure's maintained Docker task
3. Provides better security through service connections
4. Gives more control over the build/push process

## ChatGPT o1

These warnings show up because the AWS tasks from the “AWS Toolkit for Azure DevOps” extension are still internally using Node 10, which is end-of-life, and Azure DevOps is now warning about that. Unfortunately, Amazon has not yet released an updated version of the extension tasks using Node 16 (or later).  

### Key Points:
1. **The tasks are from the AWS Toolkit for Azure DevOps extension**. Version 1 of tasks like `AWSShellScript@1` and `ECRPushImage@1` use Node 10 internally.  
2. **Updating the task version** in your YAML (e.g. `AWSShellScript@2`) won’t work unless the AWS Toolkit extension itself includes a version 2 of that task. At the moment, Amazon has not published a Node 16–compatible version under a higher task version.  
3. **It is just a warning** and does not necessarily break your build. You can continue using them for the time being, but you’ll keep seeing the warnings. If Microsoft at some point decides to block tasks built on Node 10, these tasks may eventually fail.

---

## Options to Resolve or Work Around It

1. **Check for an updated AWS Toolkit extension**  
   In your Azure DevOps organization, navigate to Organization Settings → Extensions. Check if there’s a newer version of “AWS Toolkit for Azure DevOps” that might have updated tasks. Right now, Amazon has not fully released Node 16–based tasks, but you can keep an eye on updates or GitHub issues at:
   [aws/aws-toolkit-azure-devops](https://github.com/aws/aws-toolkit-azure-devops)

2. **Use your own script steps instead of the built-in AWS tasks**  
   If you don’t want to rely on the old tasks, you can run everything manually via shell scripts in standard Azure DevOps steps. For example:
   - Use a normal `script: |` step (or the built-in `bash` or `pwsh` tasks).  
   - Install `aws` CLI in that step (or on a custom self-hosted agent if you want).  
   - Run the same commands to log in to ECR, build, and push the Docker image.  
   This fully avoids the older Node 10 tasks from the AWS extension.

3. **Ignore the warning if it’s not blocking**  
   Since they’re currently only warnings, you can continue using these tasks as-is. Keep in mind that future Azure DevOps updates might block Node 10 tasks from running.  

---

### Summary

Because the AWS extension tasks still rely on Node 10, Azure DevOps raises the deprecation warning. For now, either continue using them (accepting the warning), or switch to your own scripts or custom tasks that don’t depend on Node 10. Watch for an official update from Amazon that publishes Node 16–compatible tasks in the AWS Toolkit extension.

## Analysis 

Note: The five LLMs have been anonymized in the analysis below, as follows: ChatGPT-4o is Chatbot #1, Gemini 2.0 Flash is Chatbot #2, Q is Chatbot #3, DeepSeek R1 is Chatbot #4 and ChatGPT-o1 is Chatbot #5

### 2. Completeness
- **Analysis**  
  - Mentions that upgrading to “task version 2” likely won’t help if AWS hasn’t published a Node 16 version.  
  - Suggests using standard scripts (Bash, Docker) or ignoring the warnings for now.  
  - Doesn’t give extended YAML samples, but covers the core solution.  
- **Rating**: **Satisfactory** (the main points from the baseline are all there.)

### 3. Clarity
- **Analysis**  
  - Good structure: headings with short paragraphs, direct suggestions.  
- **Rating**: **Satisfactory**

### 4. Practicality
- **Analysis**  
  - Tells the user exactly how to proceed if they need to remove the warnings: either wait for an official fix or switch to scripts.  
- **Rating**: **Satisfactory**

### **Overall Rating**
**Satisfactory**. It is quite close to the baseline, emphasizing that no official updated tasks are available yet and that manual scripting is a good workaround.
