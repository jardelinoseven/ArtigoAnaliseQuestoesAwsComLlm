Updating VPC-CNI add-on on EKS cluster

I am trying to update VPC CNI on a EKS cluster and getting this error `Updating VPC-CNI can only go up or down 1 minor version at a time`, after I tried to update only one minor version I got `Addon version specified is not supported` error so how should I do the update.

The cluster version is 1.27 my current VPC CNI version is 1.10.1 and I want to update it with terraform.

## Highest-scored answer 

I deleted it in the UI and reinstalled it. Please note, I did this on an eks cluster with no pods running.

Updating the Amazon VPC CNI plugin for an EKS cluster can be challenging due to version compatibility requirements. Here are steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

### 1. **Check Compatibility**
First, ensure that the VPC CNI version you want to upgrade to is compatible with your EKS cluster version. As of your cluster version 1.27, make sure that the target VPC CNI version supports this Kubernetes version.

### 2. **Sequential Upgrade**
AWS requires that you upgrade or downgrade the VPC CNI plugin one minor version at a time. For example, if you are on version 1.10.1, you should upgrade to 1.11.x first, then to 1.12.x, and so on.

### 3. **Find Supported Versions**
Identify the supported versions for your current setup. You can find this information in the AWS documentation or by using the AWS CLI:

```sh
aws eks describe-addon-versions --addon-name vpc-cni --kubernetes-version 1.27
```

### 4. **Upgrade Using Terraform**
Here's how you can specify the version in your Terraform configuration:

```hcl
resource "aws_eks_addon" "vpc_cni" {
  cluster_name = var.cluster_name
  addon_name   = "vpc-cni"
  addon_version = "v1.11.x" # Specify the next minor version
}
```

### 5. **Terraform Plan and Apply**
After updating the version in your Terraform configuration, run the following commands:

```sh
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### 6. **Repeat the Upgrade Process**
Repeat the above steps to upgrade from one minor version to the next until you reach the desired version.

### 7. **Manual Update (If Needed)**
If Terraform does not handle the update correctly, you might need to manually update the VPC CNI version using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI:

```sh
aws eks update-addon --cluster-name your-cluster-name --addon-name vpc-cni --addon-version v1.11.x
```

### 8. **Check for Errors**
After each upgrade step, monitor the logs and health of your cluster and VPC CNI plugin to ensure that there are no issues.

### Summary Steps
1. Verify compatibility with EKS version 1.27.
2. Sequentially upgrade one minor version at a time.
3. Use the AWS CLI to find supported versions.
4. Update Terraform configuration and apply changes.
5. Repeat until the desired version is reached.

If you continue to face issues, check the AWS forums or open a support ticket with AWS for more tailored assistance.


## ChatGPT-4

The user is encountering a couple of issues when attempting to update the VPC-CNI add-on in their Amazon EKS cluster. Here are some steps and considerations to help resolve these problems:

1. **Check Supported Versions**: Ensure that the version you are trying to update to is supported by the EKS cluster version you are using. AWS maintains specific versions of VPC-CNI that are compatible with each EKS version. You can find this information in the [Amazon EKS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-vpc-cni.html).

2. **Version Upgrade Path**: According to the error message, AWS restricts updating the VPC-CNI plugin to only one minor version at a time. Since your current version is 1.10.1 and you're running EKS 1.27, check the documentation to find the incremental versions you need to step through to reach a version that is both supported by EKS 1.27 and newer than 1.10.1. You may need to perform multiple sequential updates.

3. **Terraform Configuration**: When using Terraform to manage EKS resources, ensure your Terraform configurations are up to date and aligned with the requirements of the EKS and VPC-CNI versions. Here's a generic example of how you might configure the VPC-CNI update:

    ```hcl
    resource "aws_eks_addon" "vpc_cni" {
      cluster_name   = "<your-cluster-name>"
      addon_name     = "vpc-cni"
      addon_version  = "1.10.2"  # Example: upgrade to the next minor version first
      resolve_conflicts = "OVERWRITE"
    }
    ```

    Adjust the `addon_version` field to the next sequential version you need.

4. **Apply Incremental Changes**: Use Terraform to apply these changes incrementally. After updating your Terraform configuration to the next minor version, apply the changes:

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

    Verify that the upgrade was successful in the AWS Management Console or by using the AWS CLI before proceeding to the next version.

5. **Troubleshoot Failures**: If a version upgrade fails, check the EKS control plane and addon logs for more detailed error messages. Use these logs to troubleshoot specific issues that might be occurring due to configuration errors or compatibility issues.

6. **Review Terraform State and Logs**: Make sure your Terraform state is accurate and reflects the current state of your resources. Check Terraform logs for any errors that might give more insight into what might be going wrong during the upgrade process.

By following these steps, the user should be able to incrementally update the VPC-CNI add-on in their EKS cluster to a supported version that works with their cluster configuration and version.

Understanding the Issue
The user is facing difficulties in updating the VPC CNI add-on on their EKS cluster. The primary challenges are:
The VPC CNI add-on can only be updated one minor version at a time.
There seems to be a mismatch between the desired VPC CNI version and the supported versions for the EKS cluster.
Potential Solutions
1. Gradual Updates:
Break down the update: Given the limitation of updating only one minor version at a time, you'll need to perform multiple updates. For example, if you're currently on 1.10.1 and want to reach 1.14.0, you'll need to update to 1.11.x, then 1.12.x, and so on.
Check supported versions: Always verify that the target minor version is supported for your EKS cluster version (1.27).
Use AWS CLI or Terraform: You can use either the aws eks update-addon command or Terraform to perform the updates.
2. Leverage Terraform:
Terraform configuration: Ensure your Terraform configuration accurately reflects the desired VPC CNI version.
Terraform apply: Apply the Terraform configuration to initiate the update.
Incremental changes: Make incremental changes to the VPC CNI version in your Terraform configuration to avoid large jumps.
3. Consider EKS Managed Node Groups:
Simplified updates: If you're using EKS Managed Node Groups, consider leveraging them for easier VPC CNI updates. Managed Node Groups often handle updates automatically.
4. Check for Compatibility:
Verify compatibility: Always ensure that the VPC CNI version you're targeting is compatible with your EKS cluster version and other components in your environment.
Consult documentation: Refer to the official AWS EKS documentation for specific guidance on VPC CNI updates and compatibility.
Example Terraform Configuration (Basic):
Terraform
resource "aws_eks_addon" "vpc_cni" {
  name               = "vpc-cni"
  cluster_name       = "my-cluster"
  addon_version     = "v1.11.0-eksbuild.2" # Replace with the desired version
}


Additional Considerations:
Backup and restore: Create backups of your cluster configuration before making significant changes.
Testing: Thoroughly test your cluster after each update to ensure functionality.
Monitoring: Monitor the update process for any issues or unexpected behavior.
By following these steps and considering the additional points, you should be able to successfully update your VPC CNI add-on on the EKS cluster.
Would you like to provide more details about your specific setup, such as the exact VPC CNI version you want to reach and any error messages you're encountering? This could help in providing more tailored recommendations.
