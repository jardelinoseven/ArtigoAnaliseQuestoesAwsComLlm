AWS Cognito authoriser gives 403 error with the valid token

I created Cognito authoriser for API Gateway and seems it throw 403 error when use the real token. I have tested this using test utility which comes with api gateway authoriser itself.
Created both ID token and user token using Cognito UI with the valid user. But seems the token is invalid. Anyone got same experience with auth errors when using Cognito authoriser?


## Baseline answer 

I had same issue with ID token and access token. When you try the test utility, you need to use ID token and when you use a client like postman, then you need to use the access token. little bit confusing.

This is a good explanation (Cognito Authoriser): https://youtu.be/9crTLAT_4uY This is for Lambda authorizer: https://youtu.be/rRQbVJhlpC4

### **Troubleshooting AWS Cognito Authorizer 403 Errors in API Gateway**
If your AWS API Gateway **Cognito Authorizer** is returning **403 Forbidden** despite using a valid token, here are the likely causes and how to fix them.

---

## **Possible Causes and Solutions**
### **1. Ensure the Token is Being Sent in the Correct Format**
- API Gateway expects the token to be passed in the **Authorization** header in this format:
  ```http
  Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
  ```
- If your request omits `"Bearer "` before the token, API Gateway may reject it.

### **How to Check?**
Try sending the request with `curl`:
```sh
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ID_TOKEN" https://your-api.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/protected-endpoint
```

✅ **Solution:** Ensure your API client correctly formats the token.

---

### **2. Verify the Token Type (ID Token vs. Access Token)**
AWS Cognito issues **three types of tokens**:  
- **ID Token** → Contains user profile claims (email, name, etc.)  
- **Access Token** → Used for API authorization  
- **Refresh Token** → Used to get new tokens  

🔴 **Common Mistake:** Using the **ID Token** instead of the **Access Token**. API Gateway expects the **Access Token**.

### **How to Check?**
Decode the JWT token using:
```sh
jwt decode YOUR_TOKEN --no-verify
```
Or use [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) to inspect it.

✅ **Solution:** Ensure you are passing the **Access Token** (`access_token`) and **not the ID Token**.

---

### **3. Ensure Cognito User Pool Authorizer is Configured Correctly**
If the API Gateway authorizer is misconfigured, even a valid token will return a **403 error**.

#### **Check These Configurations in API Gateway:**
1. **Cognito User Pool ARN is Correct**  
   - Go to **API Gateway → Authorizers**  
   - Ensure the Cognito User Pool **ARN** matches your Cognito pool.

2. **Token Source Matches the Authorization Header**  
   - Go to **API Gateway → Authorizers → Token Source**  
   - Ensure it is set to `"Authorization"` (case-sensitive).

✅ **Solution:** If incorrect, update the API Gateway Authorizer settings and **deploy** the API again.

---

### **4. Verify API Gateway Integration with Cognito**
Ensure that your Cognito user pool is correctly set to allow authentication:

```sh
aws cognito-idp describe-user-pool --user-pool-id YOUR_POOL_ID
```

✅ **Solution:** If Cognito is misconfigured, verify:
- The **user exists** in the Cognito user pool.
- The user has the correct permissions to access the API.

---

### **5. Validate the Cognito JWT Signature**
API Gateway verifies the JWT signature before granting access. If the signature is invalid or expired, API Gateway will return a **403**.

### **How to Check?**
Decode your token and check the `"exp"` (expiration) claim:
```sh
jwt decode YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN --no-verify
```
- If the token is expired, refresh it.
- Ensure your API Gateway has the correct **Cognito JSON Web Key (JWK)**.

✅ **Solution:** Regenerate a fresh **Access Token** and try again.

---

### **6. Check API Gateway Logs for More Details**
If you’re still facing issues, enable **API Gateway execution logs**:

```sh
aws apigateway update-stage --rest-api-id YOUR_API_ID --stage-name YOUR_STAGE --patch-operations op=replace,path=/*/*/logging/dataTrace,value=true
```
Then check logs in **CloudWatch** for error details.

✅ **Solution:** Identify any API Gateway validation failures.

---

## **Final Recommendations**
| **Potential Issue** | **How to Check?** | **Solution** |
|---------------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Incorrect Token Type (ID Token vs. Access Token)** | Decode JWT (`jwt decode`) | Use the **Access Token**, not the ID Token |
| **Authorization Header Format Incorrect** | Check HTTP request headers | Ensure `"Bearer <TOKEN>"` format |
| **Cognito User Pool ARN Incorrect** | API Gateway Authorizer settings | Ensure the correct Cognito Pool ARN |
| **Expired or Invalid Token** | Decode JWT and check `"exp"` claim | Generate a fresh token |
| **Incorrect Token Source** | API Gateway settings | Ensure `"Authorization"` is set as Token Source |
| **API Gateway Logs Show Rejection** | Enable CloudWatch logs | Debug CloudWatch logs for errors |

This is a common issue when setting up AWS Cognito authorizers with API Gateway. A 403 error with a seemingly valid token points to a few potential problems. Let's troubleshoot this step-by-step:

**1. Token Validation Issues:**

* **Incorrect Token Type:**
    * API Gateway Cognito authorizers typically work with ID tokens. Ensure you are sending the ID token, not the access token or refresh token.
* **Token Expiration:**
    * Verify that the token has not expired. Cognito tokens have a limited lifespan.
* **Token Issuer (iss) Mismatch:**
    * The `iss` claim in the JWT (JSON Web Token) must match the Cognito user pool issuer URL. Double-check that the authorizer is configured with the correct user pool ID and region.
    * The issuer url should look like this: `https://cognito-idp.{region}.amazonaws.com/{userPoolId}`
* **Token Audience (aud) Mismatch:**
    * The `aud` claim in the JWT must match the API client ID associated with your user pool.
* **Token Signature Verification:**
    * API Gateway verifies the token's signature using the public keys from the Cognito user pool. If the signature verification fails, you'll get a 403. This can happen if there are issues with the JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) URL.
* **Region Mismatch:**
    * Make sure that the API gateway, and the cognito user pool are in the same AWS region.

**2. API Gateway Configuration:**

* **Authorizer Configuration:**
    * Carefully review the authorizer configuration in API Gateway. Ensure the correct Cognito user pool ID and token source (e.g., `Authorization` header) are specified.
    * Ensure that the authorizer is correctly attached to the API methods that you want to protect.
* **Resource Policy:**
    * Check the API Gateway resource policy. It might be unintentionally denying access.
* **CORS Issues:**
    * While a 403 is generally an authorization issue, CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) problems can sometimes manifest in unexpected ways. If you're calling the API from a browser, verify that CORS is correctly configured.
* **Authorizer Caching:**
    * API Gateway caches authorizer responses. If you've made changes to the authorizer or user pool, try disabling caching or invalidating the cache.

**3. Cognito User Pool Configuration:**

* **App Client Settings:**
    * Verify that the app client associated with your API Gateway has the correct settings, including the allowed OAuth flows and scopes.
* **User Pool Domain:**
    * If you are using a custom user pool domain, verify that the authorizer is configured with the correct domain.
* **User Status:**
    * Ensure that the user whose token you're using is in a confirmed and enabled state.

**4. Testing and Debugging:**

* **Decode the JWT:**
    * Use a JWT decoder (e.g., jwt.io) to inspect the token's claims. This will help you verify the `iss`, `aud`, and expiration time.
* **CloudWatch Logs:**
    * Enable CloudWatch logs for API Gateway. This will provide detailed information about the authorizer's behavior, including any error messages.
* **Postman/curl:**
    * Test the API with Postman or curl to rule out any issues with your client-side code.
* **API Gateway Test Invoke:**
    * You have already used the API gateway test invoke, but double check all of the values that you are inputting into the test.
* **JWKS URL Verification:**
    * You can manually retrieve the JWKS from the following url, replacing the region and user pool id.
    * `https://cognito-idp.{region}.amazonaws.com/{userPoolId}/.well-known/jwks.json`
    * Verify that the keys within the JWKS are valid.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1.  **Verify Token:** Decode the JWT to inspect its claims, paying close attention to `iss`, `aud`, and `exp`.
2.  **Check Authorizer Configuration:** Double-check the authorizer settings in API Gateway.
3.  **Review Cognito App Client:** Ensure the app client is correctly configured.
4.  **Enable CloudWatch Logs:** Analyze the logs for error messages.
5.  **Test with Postman/curl:** Rule out client-side issues.
6.  **Verify JWKS:** Manually verify the JWKS URL and its contents.
7.  **Region Consistency:** Make certain all AWS resources are in the same region.

By systematically working through these steps, you should be able to identify the root cause of the 403 error and resolve the issue.



## Q

**This response might contain information related to security, a nuanced topic. You should verify the response using informed human judgement. Visit [Security in Amazon Q Developer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/security.html) for more details.**

It seems you're encountering a 403 Forbidden error when using a Cognito authorizer with API Gateway, even though you believe you're using a valid token. This is a common issue that can occur due to various reasons. Let's go through some troubleshooting steps to help resolve this:

1. Verify token validity:
   - Ensure that the token you're using hasn't expired. Cognito tokens have a limited lifespan.
   - Check if you're using the correct token type (ID token or Access token) as required by your API configuration.

2. Check API Gateway configuration:
   - Confirm that the Cognito User Pool ID in the authorizer configuration matches the one you're using to generate tokens.
   - Verify that the API has been deployed after making any changes to the authorizer settings.

3. Review OAuth Scopes:
   - If you've configured OAuth Scopes on your API methods, ensure that the token you're using contains these scopes.
   - For simple authentication without custom scopes, try leaving the OAuth Scopes field blank in the API Gateway method settings.

4. Check Cognito User Pool settings:
   - Verify that the app client used to obtain the token is correctly configured in your Cognito User Pool.
   - Ensure that the app client settings allow the grant types you're using (e.g., authorization code, implicit).

5. Examine token claims:
   - Decode your token using a tool like jwt.io and verify that the claims (especially 'iss' and 'aud') match your Cognito User Pool and API Gateway configurations.

6. Test with Postman:
   - If you're not already using Postman, try setting up a request with the Authorization type set to "Bearer Token" and use your ID token.

7. Check CloudWatch Logs:
   - Enable detailed CloudWatch logging for your API Gateway and examine the logs for more specific error messages.

To verify if the problem has been solved:
1. Generate a new token from your Cognito User Pool.
2. Use this fresh token to make a request to your API.
3. If you receive a successful response (usually a 200 OK status), the issue has been resolved.

If you're still encountering issues after trying these steps, I recommend reaching out to AWS Support for more in-depth assistance. They can provide specific guidance based on your account and configuration details.

Remember to always follow security best practices, such as using the principle of least privilege when configuring permissions and regularly rotating credentials.

## DeepSeek R1

Here’s a structured approach to troubleshoot and resolve the **Cognito Authorizer 403 error** despite using a valid token:

---

### **1. Validate Token Type**
- **Use an ID Token**, *not* an Access Token.  
  Cognito Authorizers for API Gateway require the **ID token** for validation.  
  - Verify the token type by decoding it at [jwt.io](https://jwt.io).  
  - Ensure `token_use: id` is present in the token claims.

---

### **2. Check Authorizer Configuration**
#### **a. Audience (`aud` Claim) Mismatch**
   - The **Client ID** configured in the Cognito User Pool must match the `aud` claim in the token.  
   - **Fix**: In the API Gateway Authorizer settings:  
     - Set **Token Source** to `Authorization` header.  
     - Ensure **Audience** matches the Cognito App Client ID.  

#### **b. Issuer (`iss` Claim) Mismatch**
   - The `iss` claim in the token must match the Cognito User Pool’s URL.  
     Format: `https://cognito-idp.{region}.amazonaws.com/{userPoolId}`  
   - **Fix**: Update the Authorizer’s **Issuer** field to match the token’s `iss` claim.

---

### **3. Verify Scopes and Permissions**
- If the API method requires **OAuth scopes**, ensure the token includes them in the `scope` claim.  
  - Example: Token must include `scope: "myapi/read"` if the API method requires it.  
  - **Fix**: Adjust the Cognito App Client’s **Allowed OAuth Scopes** to match the API’s requirements.

---

### **4. Check Token Expiration**
- Decode the token and confirm the `exp` (expiration time) is in the future.  
  - Tokens expire after 1 hour by default. Generate a new token if expired.  
  - **Fix**: Use Cognito’s `InitiateAuth` API to refresh tokens if needed.

---

### **5. Validate Cognito User Pool Region**
- Ensure the **User Pool Region** in the token’s `iss` claim matches the region configured in the API Gateway Authorizer.  
  Example: `us-east-1` vs. `us-west-2`.

---

### **6. Disable Authorizer Caching**
Temporarily disable caching to rule out stale configurations:  
- In API Gateway → Authorizer → **TTL**: Set to `0` (disable).  
- Retest the API.

---

### **7. Enable CloudWatch Logs**
Check API Gateway execution logs for detailed error causes:  
1. In API Gateway → **Settings** → Enable **CloudWatch Logs**.  
2. Reproduce the error and inspect logs for messages like:  
   - `"Unauthorized: Invalid token"`  
   - `"Invalid scope"`  
   - `"Token expired"`

---

### **8. Test with AWS CLI**
Use the `aws apigateway test-invoke-authorizer` command to validate the token:  
```bash
aws apigateway test-invoke-authorizer \
  --rest-api-id YOUR_API_ID \
  --authorizer-id YOUR_AUTHORIZER_ID \
  --headers Authorization="Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

---

### **9. Confirm CORS Configuration**
Misconfigured CORS can sometimes trigger 403 errors. Ensure:  
- The `OPTIONS` method does **not** require authorization.  
- Response headers include `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` (or your domain).

---

### **10. Recreate the Authorizer (Last Resort)**
If misconfiguration persists:  
1. Delete the existing Authorizer.  
2. Recreate it with identical settings (double-check fields).  

---

### **Common Pitfalls**
- **Extra Whitespace**: Ensure the `Authorization` header value has no extra spaces (e.g., `Bearer[space]Token`).  
- **Multiple Authorizers**: Conflicting authorizers on the same API method.  
- **Incorrect Token Source**: Authorizer configured to read the token from `Header: X-Token` but client sends `Authorization: Bearer`.

---

### **Final Checks**
1. **Token Signature**: Verify the token is signed by Cognito (decode at [jwt.io](https://jwt.io)).  
2. **User Pool Status**: Ensure the user pool is active and the user is confirmed.  
3. **App Client Settings**: In Cognito → **App Client Settings**:  
   - Enable **Authorization Code Grant** or **Implicit Grant**.  
   - Set **Callback URL** correctly.  

By methodically addressing these areas, the 403 error should resolve. Let me know if you need further clarification! 🚀

## ChatGPT-o1

Below are some common causes and solutions for getting a 403 response from an API Gateway Authorizer configured with Amazon Cognito, even when you believe you have a “valid” token:

---

## 1. Using the Wrong Token Type
**Issue:** You might be passing the ID token (the “id_token” JWT) rather than the Access token (“access_token”). For a typical API Gateway -> Cognito User Pool authorizer, **the authorizer expects the Access token** (unless you explicitly configured it to accept the ID token).

- **How to check:** Look at the JWT contents (e.g., using jwt.io) and see whether `token_use` is `id` or `access`. If it’s `id`, you’re using the ID token. The default Cognito authorizer flow typically requires an `access` token.
- **Solution:** Make sure your client code or test harness is providing the correct Access token in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

---

## 2. Missing or Incorrect “Bearer” Prefix in the Header
**Issue:** API Gateway by default expects the token in the HTTP header `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`.  
**Solution:**
1. Double-check your request has the header set exactly to `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.  
2. If your authorizer is configured with a custom “identity source,” confirm that it matches how you’re passing the token.

---

## 3. Token is Expired or Signed by the Wrong User Pool
**Issue:** Even a valid JWT can fail if it’s from a different user pool or has expired.  
**Solution:**
1. Inspect the `exp` (expiration) field in the JWT payload.  
2. Inspect the `iss` (issuer) field – it should match something like `https://cognito-idp.<region>.amazonaws.com/<user_pool_id>`.  
3. Make sure the region and user pool ID in your authorizer settings match your actual user pool.

---

## 4. Incorrect Audience (“aud” claim) or Client ID Mismatch
**Issue:** If you configure your Cognito authorizer to validate the `aud` field, it must match the client ID of the app client in your Cognito user pool.  
**Solution:**
1. If you’re using the Access token, the `aud` claim is typically the user pool’s “client_id.”  
2. Confirm your authorizer is set to the correct “App client” in the user pool.  
3. Check the tokens via a debugger to see if `aud` matches exactly.

---

## 5. Authorizer Test Tool vs. Real Request
**Issue:** The “test” feature in the API Gateway console can fail if you don’t provide the header in the exact format the authorizer expects, or if the test environment cannot connect properly to Cognito.  
**Solution:**
1. Try making an actual `curl` or Postman request with `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` to your API’s endpoint.  
2. Validate if the real external request works, ruling out any console test quirks.

---

## 6. Region or ARN Mismatch in the Authorizer Configuration
**Issue:** If you configured your Cognito Authorizer with the wrong region, or used an ARN that references a different user pool, the token signature will fail.  
**Solution:**
1. Double-check the “Cognito User Pool” dropdown (or ARN) in the API Gateway Authorizer settings. Make sure it matches the actual region and user pool ID where your user is authenticated.  
2. Make sure your user pool is indeed in the same AWS account and region as the API Gateway authorizer (cross-region or cross-account setups need extra configuration).

---

## 7. Scope / Claim Requirements (Custom Scopes)
**Issue:** If your authorizer expects certain scopes or custom claims (e.g., via “Resource Server” settings in Cognito or custom claims in the token) and they’re missing, you may get 403.  
**Solution:**
1. If your authorizer is configured to require a specific scope, verify the Access token you obtained actually includes that scope.  
2. Confirm you are requesting scopes in the OAuth2 flow, if applicable.

---

## 8. Sync / Deployment Delays or Stale Tokens
Sometimes tokens minted before making changes to your user pool or authorizer can fail because the authorizer’s configuration changed. Try:
1. Generating a fresh token after your final user pool configuration.  
2. Ensuring you didn’t keep an old user pool or app client ID that no longer exists.

---

### Quick Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Verify Token Type**: Check that you’re sending an Access token (`token_use=access`), not an ID token.  
2. **Header Format**: Must be `Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>`.  
3. **Inspect JWT**: Confirm `iss` includes the correct region + user pool ID, `aud` matches your app client ID, and `exp` is in the future.  
4. **Check API Gateway Authorizer Config**: Compare the user pool region + ID in the authorizer with your token’s claims.  
5. **Try a Fresh Token**: Log in again, confirm the user is in the right user pool, then call your API.  
6. **Scope Requirements**: If you have configured a “Resource server” with custom scopes in Cognito, ensure your request includes them and the authorizer is checking the right scopes.  

Following these steps typically resolves the dreaded 403 error when using a Cognito User Pool authorizer on API Gateway.

## Analysis 

Note: The five LLMs have been anonymized in the analysis below, as follows: ChatGPT-4o is Chatbot #1, Gemini 2.0 Flash is Chatbot #2, Q is Chatbot #3, DeepSeek R1 is Chatbot #4 and ChatGPT-o1 is Chatbot #5

Below is a structured evaluation of each chatbot response against the **baseline answer** from Stack Overflow. The baseline states:

> When testing Cognito Authorizers in the API Gateway test utility, you should use the **ID token**. However, when making real requests (e.g., from Postman), you need to use the **Access token**. This can be confusing but is crucial for preventing 403 errors.

---

# Baseline Key Points

1. **Using the ID token** in the test utility is correct.  
2. **Using the Access token** for external requests from tools like Postman is correct.  
3. The confusion lies in which token to provide in each scenario, and that mixing them up can result in 403 Forbidden errors.

---

## Chatbot Response #1

**Overview**  
- Lists potential issues: token format, incorrect token type, authorizer misconfiguration, JWT signature checks, and logs.  
- Emphasizes that for API Gateway, typically an **Access token** is expected.  

### 1. Accuracy
- The baseline specifically points out that for the API Gateway “Test” feature, you must supply the ID token, but for external requests (like Postman) you must use the Access token.  
- Response #1 states that the API Gateway expects the Access token (and warns about not to confuse it with the ID token). This aligns partially with the baseline’s mention that an ID token is used for the test utility.  
- Response #1 does not explicitly note that the test utility uses the ID token, so it doesn’t fully mirror the baseline’s key distinction for “test utility vs. real requests.”  
- However, the overall guidance that you must confirm using the correct token type is in line with the baseline’s root cause.  
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory** (Accurate in describing the difference between ID and Access tokens, but misses that “test utility requires ID token, external requests require Access token” detail.)

### 2. Completeness
- Covers multiple reasons for 403 errors (header format, correct token type, user pool config, token signature).  
- The baseline’s biggest point is that for the built-in test, an ID token is needed; for external clients, an Access token. Response #1 does not call out that the test utility specifically needs an ID token while external requests need the Access token.  
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory** (It’s thorough about general troubleshooting but does not highlight the specific test utility vs. real request scenario from the baseline.)

### 3. Clarity
- Response #1 is well-structured (possible causes with headings, bullet points, code snippets). It’s fairly clear.  
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

### 4. Practicality
- Very practical: enumerates checks and potential solutions (e.g., decode token, ensure correct header format, check logs).  
- Missing only the baseline’s specific mention about the difference in tokens for the test utility vs. Postman.  
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #1)**: **Partially Satisfactory**  
It’s generally correct and practical, but misses the baseline’s specific test-utility vs. external-request nuance.

---

## Chatbot Response #2

**Overview**  
- Mentions token validation, potential token mismatch (ID vs. Access), expiration, signature verification, configuration (authorizer, resource policy, CORS, caching), user pool config.  
- Specifically states: “API Gateway Cognito authorizers typically work with ID tokens. Ensure you are sending the ID token, not the access token.”  

### 1. Accuracy
- The baseline says the built-in test tool uses the **ID token**, but real calls with Postman should use the **Access token**.  
- Response #2 says “API Gateway Cognito authorizers typically work with ID tokens,” which might contradict the baseline scenario. Actually, in many cases, the Cognito authorizer uses the ID token only for the test utility, but an Access token is typically needed for real API calls.  
- So, there’s a **potential mismatch** from the baseline’s “For real requests, use an Access token” stance.  
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory** (It acknowledges the token mismatch concept, but it flips it, stating “ID token” is typical for Cognito authorizers, which conflicts with the baseline’s real usage scenario.)

### 2. Completeness
- Very thorough about other factors: token expiration, region mismatch, etc.  
- Does not mention the specific scenario from the baseline that you must supply the ID token for the built-in test but an Access token in Postman. Instead, it states that ID tokens are typically used in API Gateway, which can be misleading if the user is specifically referencing external calls.  
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory** (Comprehensive but not fully aligned with the baseline’s distinction.)

### 3. Clarity
- The structure is fairly clear. It enumerates each potential cause.  
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

### 4. Practicality
- Provides a systematic checklist (token claims, logs, region, resource policy). Very practical, but the mismatch with the baseline’s key usage scenario (ID token for testing, Access token for real calls) can cause confusion.  
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #2)**: **Partially Satisfactory**  
It’s detailed but not entirely consistent with the baseline’s main advice about which token to use in each scenario.

---

## Chatbot Response #3

**Overview**  
- Summarizes potential causes: token validity, correct token type, checks for user pool ID, deployment, or client settings.  
- Suggests decoding the token, checking claims, verifying OAuth scopes, using Postman.  

### 1. Accuracy
- The baseline says ID token for test utility, Access token for real external calls. This response says “Ensure you’re using the correct token type (ID or Access) as required by your API configuration.”  
- This is somewhat general. It doesn’t explicitly identify that the test utility requires the ID token, while real calls need Access.  
- The statement is still correct that the user must confirm which type of token is required, so it’s not necessarily wrong.  
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory** (Accurate in general about ensuring correct token type, but does not specifically match the baseline’s test-utility vs. real usage scenario.)

### 2. Completeness
- Mentions the crucial token mismatch possibility, but not in the same detail as the baseline.  
- Also covers typical checks (app client settings, user status, CloudWatch logs).  
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory** (Does not highlight the specific scenario from the baseline but is fairly complete in broader sense.)

### 3. Clarity
- Explains clearly in bullet points, references the user pool config, user status, and so on.  
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

### 4. Practicality
- Provides real steps: decode the JWT, check logs, test with Postman, talk to AWS Support.  
- Good general approach, although not specifically pointing out the ID vs. Access token difference for test utility vs. real requests.  
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #3)**: **Partially Satisfactory**

---

## Chatbot Response #4

**Overview**  
- Lists a methodical approach: validates token type, checks audience mismatch, scopes, expiration, region config, logs, etc.  
- Specifically states “Use an ID Token, not an Access Token. Cognito Authorizers require the ID token for validation,” which is actually reversing the baseline’s statement that real calls typically use an Access token.  

### 1. Accuracy
- The baseline clarifies that the built-in test feature uses an ID token, while calls from Postman need an Access token.  
- This response explicitly claims “Use an ID Token” for Cognito authorizers. That’s contradictory to the baseline advice for real requests.  
- In practice, some configurations do use ID tokens for Cognito authorizers, but the question references the confusion from the baseline that says “Test utility → ID token, real usage → Access token.”  
**Rating**: **Unsatisfactory** (It strongly insists on ID token for the authorizer overall, which runs counter to the question’s baseline that acknowledges Access token usage for actual requests.)

### 2. Completeness
- Covers many potential issues: mismatch in claims, scopes, caching, logs, region mismatch. Thorough in general troubleshooting.  
- Omits the nuance that the test utility differs from a typical external request.  
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory** (It’s thorough but ironically incomplete with regard to the baseline’s core point.)

### 3. Clarity
- Good structured layout (numbered steps, references to `aud`, `iss`).  
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

### 4. Practicality
- Provides real solutions: checking audience, disabling caching, enabling logs. Good general suggestions.  
- The main token guidance can cause confusion, though, if the user actually needs an Access token for real requests.  
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #4)**: **Partially Satisfactory**  
Its statement “Use an ID Token, not an Access Token” is directly at odds with the baseline’s recommended approach for external usage. That’s a major factual conflict.

## Chatbot Response #5

**Overview**  
- Stresses that typically the user pool authorizer wants the Access token, and if you supply the ID token, it might fail.  
- Mentions other causes (header format, expired or incorrect region, mismatch in `aud`, user pool domain, etc.).  
- Distinguishes the difference between ID tokens vs. Access tokens, saying “often the authorizer expects the Access token,” which aligns with the baseline’s real usage scenario. However, it does not mention that the test utility uses the ID token.  

### 1. Accuracy
- The baseline states that the “test” utility uses ID token, but real calls (Postman) need Access token. This response says that often for Cognito user pools with API Gateway, you need an Access token.  
- That’s consistent with the baseline’s note about using an Access token in Postman.  
- However, it doesn’t explicitly mention the test utility requiring the ID token.  
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory** (Accurate in explaining real usage with Access tokens but omits the test-utility-specific detail.)

### 2. Completeness
- Thorough about token claims, region mismatches, audience mismatches, scopes, stale tokens.  
- Doesn’t mention the confusion that the test utility specifically needs the ID token.  
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

### 3. Clarity
- Well structured, bullet points, headings, short paragraphs. Quite clear overall.  
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

### 4. Practicality
- Very actionable tips. The mention of “Check if you’re using an Access token or ID token” is highly relevant. Lacks the direct mention that the test utility uses ID token, but the user can deduce the token type from the claims.  
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #5)**: **Partially Satisfactory**  
Accurate in describing that real usage typically needs Access tokens, but doesn’t mention the ID token requirement for the test utility specifically.

# Summary of All Responses

## Accuracy
- **None** of the responses explicitly states the baseline’s precise nuance: **the built-in test utility uses an ID token** while **actual external calls (Postman) use an Access token**.  
- Responses #2, #4 say that the Cognito authorizer typically uses the ID token for real usage, which is contrary to the baseline scenario.  
- **All** mention the general concept of ID vs. Access token confusion, though some invert the recommended usage.

## Completeness
- All are fairly thorough about general Cognito authorizer troubleshooting: checking claims, region, token expiration, JWT signature, etc.  
- **Missing** from every response is the explicit mention that the test utility expects an ID token, while Postman calls typically require an Access token (the core of the baseline’s confusion).

## Clarity
- All responses have decently organized structures with bullet points or headings, generally clear.  
- They do not all explicitly clarify the difference in the test utility vs. external usage, so that might create confusion if a user is referencing the baseline’s scenario specifically.

## Practicality
- All provide steps that are helpful in diagnosing 403 errors.  
- The mismatch with the baseline’s specific scenario (ID token for test utility, Access token for external requests) could cause confusion, but in general they’re quite practical for broader “403 error with Cognito” debugging.

# Overall Best Response
Judging strictly by alignment with the baseline and general quality:

- Responses that emphasize using **Access token** (Response #1, #5) for real usage are closer to the baseline’s message for external calls.  
- However, none clarifies that the built-in test utility uses the ID token.  
- **Response #1** stands out for thoroughly listing many possible causes (token format, correct token type, misconfig, logs, etc.) and specifically saying you should not confuse the ID token with the Access token. It at least alludes to the fact that the Access token is required in many real usage scenarios.  
- **Response #5** is also quite thorough and specifically says “often the authorizer expects the Access token.”  

Given the baseline, **Response #1** is probably the best overall: it warns users about mixing ID token vs. Access token and lists robust troubleshooting steps.

# Overall Worst Response
- **Response #4** explicitly claims “Use an ID Token, not an Access Token” for the Cognito authorizer. This is the most contradictory to the baseline’s real usage scenario.  
- Hence, **Response #4** is the worst in terms of matching the baseline’s guidance about which token type is used when.

---

## Final Summary

**Accuracy**:  
- All recognized token type mismatch as a major cause but none precisely matched the baseline’s “ID token for test utility, Access token for external usage.”

**Completeness**:  
- All were thorough about other aspects (audience, issuer, logs, expiration). Missing the explicit mention of the baseline’s test utility vs. real usage difference.

**Clarity**:  
- All five are well-structured. #1 and #5 do a clear, concise job. #2, #3, #4 also well structured.

**Practicality**:  
- All offer workable steps for diagnosing 403 errors with Cognito. #1 and #5 are especially strong in real-world instructions.

**Overall Best Response**: **Chatbot #1**  
It explains the ID vs. Access token difference fairly well and includes many actionable troubleshooting steps.

**Overall Worst Response**: **Chatbot #4**  
Because it explicitly advises always using an ID token in the authorizer, directly conflicting with the baseline’s mention that external calls typically need an Access token.
