Update ECS task definition image tag when new image tag

I want my ECS task definition image tag updated when a newer tag exists.

In CodePipeline after I push the image with new tag, I try to update service with the following command, but it doesn't get the new image automatically, still the old one.
```
    - docker push ${DOCKERHUB_USER}/aws-dummy-api:${IMAGE_TAG}
    - aws ecs update-service --cluster my-cluster --service dummy-api-service --force-new-deployment --region eu-central-1
```

So how to get the new image tag automatically when I push a new tag?

## Highest-scored answer 

It seems I need to create a new revison with the new image tag, and update the ECS service.

Following this [github](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk/issues/406#issuecomment-1314183221) issue, I managed like this in my CodePipeline buildspec.yml:

```build:
    commands:
        - docker build -t $FULL_IMAGE --target prod .
        - docker push $FULL_IMAGE
post_build:
    commands:
        - TASK_DEFINITION=$(aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition "$TASK_FAMILY" --region "$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION")
        - NEW_TASK_DEFINITION=$(echo $TASK_DEFINITION | jq --arg IMAGE "$FULL_IMAGE" '.taskDefinition | .containerDefinitions[0].image = $IMAGE | del(.taskDefinitionArn) | del(.revision) | del(.status) | del(.requiresAttributes) | del(.compatibilities) |  del(.registeredAt)  | del(.registeredBy)')
        - NEW_TASK_INFO=$(aws ecs register-task-definition --region "$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION" --cli-input-json "$NEW_TASK_DEFINITION")
        - NEW_REVISION=$(echo $NEW_TASK_INFO | jq '.taskDefinition.revision')
        - aws ecs update-service --cluster ${ECS_CLUSTER} --service ${SERVICE_NAME} --task-definition ${TASK_FAMILY}:${NEW_REVISION}
```

To ensure that your ECS task definition image tag is updated when a new image is pushed, you need to automate the process of updating the task definition with the new image tag and then deploying the updated task definition. Here’s a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

### Step 1: Capture the New Image Tag
Ensure that your CI/CD pipeline captures the new image tag after the image is pushed. This can typically be done in your build script or as part of your CI/CD tool configuration.

### Step 2: Update the ECS Task Definition
You need to register a new task definition with the updated image tag. This can be done using the AWS CLI or SDKs. Here's an example using the AWS CLI:

1. **Retrieve the Current Task Definition**:
   ```sh
   CURRENT_TASK_DEF=$(aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition dummy-api-task --region eu-central-1)
   ```

2. **Create a New Task Definition Revision with the Updated Image Tag**:
   You can use a tool like `jq` to modify the JSON task definition. Here’s an example in a shell script:

   ```sh
   NEW_IMAGE="${DOCKERHUB_USER}/aws-dummy-api:${IMAGE_TAG}"

   # Extract the current task definition JSON, modify the container definition image, and register the new task definition
   NEW_TASK_DEF=$(echo $CURRENT_TASK_DEF | jq --arg NEW_IMAGE "$NEW_IMAGE" '.taskDefinition | .containerDefinitions[0].image = $NEW_IMAGE')

   # Register the new task definition
   aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json "$NEW_TASK_DEF" --region eu-central-1
   ```

### Step 3: Update the ECS Service to Use the New Task Definition Revision
After registering the new task definition, update the ECS service to use the new revision and force a new deployment:

```sh
# Get the latest task definition revision
LATEST_TASK_DEF=$(aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition dummy-api-task --query 'taskDefinition.taskDefinitionArn' --region eu-central-1)

# Update the ECS service to use the new task definition
aws ecs update-service --cluster my-cluster --service dummy-api-service --task-definition $LATEST_TASK_DEF --force-new-deployment --region eu-central-1
```

### Step 4: Automate the Entire Process
Integrate the above steps into your CI/CD pipeline. For example, in AWS CodePipeline, you can add a CodeBuild step to handle the task definition update:

```yaml
version: 0.2

phases:
  build:
    commands:
      - echo "Building Docker image..."
      - docker build -t ${DOCKERHUB_USER}/aws-dummy-api:${IMAGE_TAG} .
      - echo "Pushing Docker image..."
      - docker push ${DOCKERHUB_USER}/aws-dummy-api:${IMAGE_TAG}
      - echo "Updating ECS task definition..."
      - >
        CURRENT_TASK_DEF=$(aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition dummy-api-task --region eu-central-1)
      - >
        NEW_TASK_DEF=$(echo $CURRENT_TASK_DEF | jq --arg NEW_IMAGE "${DOCKERHUB_USER}/aws-dummy-api:${IMAGE_TAG}" '.taskDefinition | .containerDefinitions[0].image = $NEW_IMAGE')
      - >
        aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json "$NEW_TASK_DEF" --region eu-central-1
      - echo "Updating ECS service..."
      - >
        LATEST_TASK_DEF=$(aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition dummy-api-task --query 'taskDefinition.taskDefinitionArn' --region eu-central-1)
      - >
        aws ecs update-service --cluster my-cluster --service dummy-api-service --task-definition $LATEST_TASK_DEF --force-new-deployment --region eu-central-1
```

### Summary
1. **Push the new image**: Continue pushing the new image with the updated tag.
2. **Update the task definition**: Use the AWS CLI to register a new task definition with the updated image tag.
3. **Deploy the new task definition**: Update the ECS service to use the new task definition revision and force a new deployment.

By automating these steps in your CI/CD pipeline, your ECS service will always use the latest image tag after a new image is pushed.

To automatically update the ECS task definition with a new image tag whenever you push a new image to Docker Hub, you'll need to automate the process of updating the task definition and then triggering the ECS service to use this new definition. Here’s a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

1. **Push Image to Docker Hub**:
   You are already pushing the image with a new tag using `docker push ${DOCKERHUB_USER}/aws-dummy-api:${IMAGE_TAG}`. Ensure that this step successfully uploads your new image.

2. **Update ECS Task Definition**:
   After pushing the new image, you need to create a new revision of the ECS task definition that uses the new image tag. This step is not automatically handled by the `aws ecs update-service` command, which only triggers a redeployment using the existing task definition.

3. **Automate Task Definition Update**:
   You can automate the task definition update using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild, or by scripting using the AWS CLI or SDKs. Here’s how you can do it using a bash script as part of your CI/CD process:

   ```bash
   # Fetch the latest task definition
   TASK_FAMILY="my-task-family"
   LATEST_TASK_DEFINITION=$(aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition $TASK_FAMILY --query 'taskDefinition.taskDefinitionArn' --output text)

   # Create a new task definition with the new image
   NEW_TASK_DEFINTION=$(aws ecs register-task-definition \
     --cli-input-json "$(aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition $LATEST_TASK_DEFINITION --query 'taskDefinition' \
     | jq --arg IMAGE "${DOCKERHUB_USER}/aws-dummy-api:${IMAGE_TAG}" '.containerDefinitions[0].image = $IMAGE')" \
     --query 'taskDefinition.taskDefinitionArn' --output text)

   # Update the ECS service to use the new task definition
   aws ecs update-service --cluster my-cluster --service dummy-api-service --task-definition $NEW_TASK_DEFINTION --force-new-deployment --region eu-central-1
   ```

   In this script:
   - Replace `"my-task-family"` with your task definition family.
   - The `jq` tool is used to update the image in the task definition JSON. Make sure `jq` is installed in your CI/CD environment.
   - This script assumes you have only one container per task definition. If there are more, you will need to adjust the `jq` command.

4. **Integrate with CI/CD**:
   - Integrate the above script into your CI/CD pipeline. This can be configured in AWS CodePipeline with AWS CodeBuild or in any other CI/CD system you are using (like Jenkins, GitLab CI, etc.).
   - Ensure the pipeline triggers on every new tag push to Docker Hub.

5. **Permissions**:
   - Make sure your CI/CD system's IAM role has permissions to `ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition`, `ecs:DescribeTaskDefinitions`, and `ecs:UpdateService`.

6. **Test the Entire Flow**:
   - Make a change to your application, update the tag, and push it to Docker Hub.
   - Watch your CI/CD pipeline to ensure it triggers and executes the task definition update and service update correctly.

By automating the task definition update and redeployment, your ECS service will always run the latest image pushed under the specified tag.

There are two main approaches to automatically update your ECS task definition image tag with a new image pushed to Docker Hub:
1. CI/CD Pipeline Integration:
Pipeline Automation: Integrate your image building and deployment process into a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
Pipeline Steps:
Push Image: The pipeline should push the newly built image to Docker Hub with the desired tag.
Update Task Definition: After a successful push, the pipeline should use the AWS CLI or SDK to update the ECS task definition with the new image tag.
Bash
```  Example using AWS CLI (assuming 'aws' is configured)
aws ecs update-task-definition \
    --cluster my-cluster \
    --task-definition dummy-api-task-definition \
    --container-definitions "[{name: my-api-container, image: '${DOCKERHUB_USER}/aws-dummy-api:${IMAGE_TAG}'}]"
```



Benefits: This approach provides complete control over the update process and integrates seamlessly with your existing development workflow.
2. ECR Image Scanning on Push (Optional):
ECR Repository: If you're using Amazon ECR (AWS container registry) instead of Docker Hub, consider enabling image scanning on push.
Automatic Scanning: When you push a new image tag to ECR, it automatically scans the image for vulnerabilities.
ECS Integration: You can configure ECS to trigger a service update whenever a new image in your ECR repository passes the scan.
Additional Considerations:
Force New Deployment: The --force-new-deployment flag in your current command ensures a new deployment even if the task definition hasn't changed. However, it's generally recommended to update the task definition itself for better tracking.
Testing: Make sure your CI/CD pipeline includes proper testing stages before deploying new image versions to production.
By implementing one of these approaches, your ECS service will automatically pick up the latest image tag whenever you push a new image to your container registry. Remember to adjust the provided commands and configurations based on your specific environment and tools.


## Q

To update the ECS task definition image tag when a newer tag exists, you can follow these steps:

1. Push the new image with the updated tag to your Docker registry (e.g., Amazon ECR):
   ```
   docker push ${DOCKERHUB_USER}/aws-dummy-api:${NEW_IMAGE_TAG}
   ```

2. Update the task definition to use the new image tag:
   - Create a new revision of the task definition by copying the existing one and updating the `image` field with the new tag.
   - You can do this either manually in the ECS console or by updating the task definition JSON file and registering the new revision.

3. Update the ECS service to use the new task definition revision:
   ```
   aws ecs update-service --cluster my-cluster --service dummy-api-service --task-definition new-task-definition-arn --force-new-deployment --region eu-central-1
   ```

   This command will trigger a new deployment of the service, and ECS will automatically pull the new image with the updated tag.

The key points are:

- You need to create a new revision of the task definition with the updated image tag.
- You then need to update the ECS service to use the new task definition revision, which will trigger a new deployment and pull the latest image.
- Using the `--force-new-deployment` option ensures that ECS will pull the new image, even if the task definition has not changed.
