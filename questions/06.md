AWS Cognito authoriser gives 403 error with the valid token

I created Cognito authoriser for API Gateway and seems it throw 403 error when use the real token. I have tested this using test utility which comes with api gateway authoriser itself.
Created both ID token and user token using Cognito UI with the valid user. But seems the token is invalid. Anyone got same experience with auth errors when using Cognito authoriser?


## Highest-scored answer 

I had same issue with ID token and access token. When you try the test utility, you need to use ID token and when you use a client like postman, then you need to use the access token. little bit confusing.

This is a good explanation (Cognito Authoriser): https://youtu.be/9crTLAT_4uY This is for Lambda authorizer: https://youtu.be/rRQbVJhlpC4

It seems you're encountering a 403 Forbidden error when using a Cognito authorizer with API Gateway, even though you believe you're using a valid token. This is a common issue that can occur due to various reasons. Let's go through some troubleshooting steps to help resolve this:

1. Verify token validity:
   - Ensure that the token you're using hasn't expired. Cognito tokens have a limited lifespan.
   - Check if you're using the correct token type (ID token or Access token) as required by your API configuration.

2. Check API Gateway configuration:
   - Confirm that the Cognito User Pool ID in the authorizer configuration matches the one you're using to generate tokens.
   - Verify that the API has been deployed after making any changes to the authorizer settings.

3. Review OAuth Scopes:
   - If you've configured OAuth Scopes on your API methods, ensure that the token you're using contains these scopes.
   - For simple authentication without custom scopes, try leaving the OAuth Scopes field blank in the API Gateway method settings.

4. Check Cognito User Pool settings:
   - Verify that the app client used to obtain the token is correctly configured in your Cognito User Pool.
   - Ensure that the app client settings allow the grant types you're using (e.g., authorization code, implicit).

5. Examine token claims:
   - Decode your token using a tool like jwt.io and verify that the claims (especially 'iss' and 'aud') match your Cognito User Pool and API Gateway configurations.

6. Test with Postman:
   - If you're not already using Postman, try setting up a request with the Authorization type set to "Bearer Token" and use your ID token.

7. Check CloudWatch Logs:
   - Enable detailed CloudWatch logging for your API Gateway and examine the logs for more specific error messages.

To verify if the problem has been solved:
1. Generate a new token from your Cognito User Pool.
2. Use this fresh token to make a request to your API.
3. If you receive a successful response (usually a 200 OK status), the issue has been resolved.

If you're still encountering issues after trying these steps, I recommend reaching out to AWS Support for more in-depth assistance. They can provide specific guidance based on your account and configuration details.

Remember to always follow security best practices, such as using the principle of least privilege when configuring permissions and regularly rotating credentials.
