## [Question 23 (Feb 27, 2024)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78070470/configure-access-role-for-iam-user)

Configure access role for IAM user

I have a S3 java client which I want to run. But I get error during startup:

    Caused by: com.amazonaws.services.securitytoken.model.AWSSecurityTokenServiceException: User: arn:aws:iam::123456789:user/test-key is not authorized to perform: sts:AssumeRole on resource: arn:aws:iam::123456789:user/test-key (Service: AWSSecurityTokenService; Status Code: 403; Error Code: AccessDenied; Request ID: 3b9b4bd4-48d1-40dc-a7d-f33d1cfffbb5; Proxy: null)


Do you know how I can set this permission into AWS IAM panel? 

EDIT:

        AssumeRoleRequest assumeRequest = (new AssumeRoleRequest()).withRoleArn(awsArn).withDurationSeconds(s3Properties.getSessionDuration()).withRoleSessionName(s3Properties.getAwsSessionname());
        AWSSecurityTokenService stsClient = (AWSSecurityTokenService)((AWSSecurityTokenServiceClientBuilder)((AWSSecurityTokenServiceClientBuilder)AWSSecurityTokenServiceClientBuilder.standard().withCredentials(new AWSStaticCredentialsProvider(credentials))).withRegion(s3Properties.getAwsRegion())).build();
        AssumeRoleResult assumeResult = stsClient.assumeRole(assumeRequest);
        Credentials credentials2 = assumeResult.getCredentials();



## Baseline answer 

The error indicates that you are using an IAM user to assume an IAM user:


```
User: arn:aws:iam::123456789:user/test-key is not authorized to perform: 
sts:AssumeRole on resource: arn:aws:iam::123456789:user/test-key
```

`AssumeRole` is used with IAM *roles*, not IAM *users*. In your code snippet:

```
AssumeRoleRequest assumeRequest = (new AssumeRoleRequest()).withRoleArn(awsArn).withDurationSeconds(s3Properties.getSessionDuration()).withRoleSessionName(s3Properties.getAwsSessionname());
```

The value for `awsArn` must be an IAM user. The value should instead be an IAM role that has a trust policy allowing the `test-key` user to assume the role. Read [the documentation on AssumeRole][1] and see the example in [the AWS SDK docs][2]. I won't reproduce them here as they are quite explicit about what you need to do.

### **Fixing IAM Permission Issue: "User is not authorized to perform: sts:AssumeRole"**

Your error message indicates that your IAM user (`test-key`) does **not have permission to assume an IAM role** using **AWS STS (Security Token Service)**.

To **fix this**, you need to:
1. **Ensure the IAM user (`test-key`) has permission to assume the role**.
2. **Ensure the target role allows the IAM user to assume it**.

---

## **Solution 1: Grant `sts:AssumeRole` Permission to the IAM User**
1. **Go to AWS IAM Console → Users → `test-key`**.
2. **Attach a policy** that allows the user to assume a role:

### **IAM Policy for User (`test-key`)**
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::123456789:role/MyS3Role"
        }
    ]
}
```
✅ **Why?**
- This explicitly allows `test-key` to assume the **IAM role** `MyS3Role`.

---

## **Solution 2: Update IAM Role Trust Policy to Allow `test-key` to Assume It**
1. **Go to AWS IAM Console → Roles → MyS3Role**.
2. **Modify the Trust Relationship**.

### **Trust Policy for the Target Role (`MyS3Role`)**
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789:user/test-key"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```
✅ **Why?**
- This **allows the IAM user (`test-key`) to assume this role**.

---

## **Solution 3: Assign Required Permissions to the Role (`MyS3Role`)**
Once `test-key` assumes `MyS3Role`, the role needs permissions to access **S3**.

### **Attach S3 Access Policy to `MyS3Role`**
1. **Go to AWS IAM Console → Roles → MyS3Role**.
2. Attach the following policy:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket",
                "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

✅ **Why?**
- This allows `MyS3Role` to read/write **S3 objects**.

---

## **Solution 4: Verify and Test the Configuration**
### **Check the Permissions via AWS CLI**
Run the following command to verify `test-key` permissions:
```sh
aws sts assume-role --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789:role/MyS3Role --role-session-name TestSession
```

If successful, it should return temporary credentials.

---

## **Final Checklist**
| **Issue** | **Solution** |
|-----------|-------------|
| **IAM user (`test-key`) is not allowed to assume the role** | Attach `sts:AssumeRole` policy to `test-key` |
| **IAM role (`MyS3Role`) does not allow `test-key`** | Modify role **Trust Policy** |
| **IAM role lacks access to S3** | Attach `s3:ListBucket` and `s3:GetObject` permissions |
| **Need to test if assume role works** | Run `aws sts assume-role` via CLI |

After these fixes, your **Java AWS SDK (STS AssumeRole)** code should work without the **403 AccessDenied error**.

The error message clearly indicates that the IAM user `test-key` is attempting to perform an `sts:AssumeRole` operation, but it lacks the necessary permissions. This means the user's IAM policy doesn't allow it to assume the specified role.

Here's a breakdown of the problem and the solution:

**Understanding the Problem:**

* **`sts:AssumeRole`:**
    * This action allows an IAM user or role to temporarily assume the permissions of another IAM role.
    * It's used to grant temporary access to resources without permanently assigning permissions to the user.
* **Access Denied:**
    * The `AccessDenied` error signifies that the IAM user `test-key` doesn't have the explicit permission to perform `sts:AssumeRole` on the role specified in the `assumeRequest`.
* **Incorrect Role ARN:**
    * The error message shows that the user is trying to assume a role with the ARN `arn:aws:iam::123456789:user/test-key`. This is incorrect. a user cannot assume itself. the role arn must be a role, not a user.

**Solution:**

1.  **Identify the Correct Role ARN:**

    * The most critical step is to identify the correct ARN of the IAM *role* that the Java client should be assuming.
    * This role should have the necessary permissions to access the S3 bucket.
    * In the AWS IAM console, go to "Roles" and find the role you want to use. Copy its ARN.

2.  **Modify the IAM User's Policy:**

    * You need to add a policy to the `test-key` IAM user that grants it permission to assume the identified role.
    * **Steps in the AWS IAM Console:**
        1.  Go to "Users" and select the `test-key` user.
        2.  Go to the "Permissions" tab.
        3.  Click "Add permissions" and select "Attach policies directly."
        4.  Click "Create inline policy".
        5.  Select the "JSON" tab.
        6.  Paste the following policy, replacing `arn:aws:iam::123456789:role/YourS3AccessRole` with the correct ARN of the role:

        ```json
        {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
                    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::123456789:role/YourS3AccessRole"
                }
            ]
        }
        ```

        7.  Click "Review policy," give it a name (e.g., `AllowAssumeS3Role`), and click "Create policy."

3.  **Update Java Code:**

    * Ensure that the `awsArn` variable in your Java code contains the correct ARN of the IAM *role* you want to assume, and not the user arn.
    * Ensure that the role named in the java code, matches the role that the user is given access to assume.

**Example Java Code (with correction):**

```java
AssumeRoleRequest assumeRequest = (new AssumeRoleRequest())
        .withRoleArn("arn:aws:iam::123456789:role/YourS3AccessRole") // Replace with the correct role ARN!
        .withDurationSeconds(s3Properties.getSessionDuration())
        .withRoleSessionName(s3Properties.getAwsSessionname());

AWSSecurityTokenService stsClient = ((AWSSecurityTokenServiceClientBuilder)
        ((AWSSecurityTokenServiceClientBuilder)
                AWSSecurityTokenServiceClientBuilder.standard()
                        .withCredentials(new AWSStaticCredentialsProvider(credentials)))
                .withRegion(s3Properties.getAwsRegion()))
        .build();

AssumeRoleResult assumeResult = stsClient.assumeRole(assumeRequest);
Credentials credentials2 = assumeResult.getCredentials();
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Least Privilege:**
    * Always follow the principle of least privilege. Grant only the necessary permissions to the IAM user and the role.
* **Role Permissions:**
    * The IAM role that the user assumes must have the permissions required to access the S3 bucket.
    * Verify the role policy grants the s3 actions needed.
* **Session Duration:**
    * The `DurationSeconds` parameter in the `AssumeRoleRequest` determines how long the temporary credentials will be valid.
* **Role Session Name:**
    * The `RoleSessionName` parameter helps to identify the sessions in CloudTrail logs.

By following these steps, the user should be able to grant the necessary permissions and successfully assume the IAM role.

To resolve the **"not authorized to perform: sts:AssumeRole"** error, follow these steps to configure IAM permissions correctly:

---

### **1. Create an IAM Role (If Not Existing)**
1. Go to **IAM Console → Roles → Create Role**.
2. **Trusted entity type**: *AWS account*.
3. **Account ID**: Your own account ID (e.g., `123456789`).
4. Attach policies like **AmazonS3FullAccess** (adjust based on your needs).
5. Name the role (e.g., `S3AccessRole`).

---

### **2. Update the Role’s Trust Policy**
Add the IAM user (`test-key`) as a trusted entity in the role’s trust policy:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789:user/test-key" // Replace with your user ARN
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### **3. Grant the User Permission to Assume the Role**
Attach this policy to the IAM user (`test-key`):
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::123456789:role/S3AccessRole" // Replace with your role ARN
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### **4. Fix the Java Code**
Use the **role ARN** (not the user ARN) in `AssumeRoleRequest`:
```java
// Replace "arn:aws:iam::123456789:user/test-key" with the role ARN
String awsArn = "arn:aws:iam::123456789:role/S3AccessRole"; 

AssumeRoleRequest assumeRequest = new AssumeRoleRequest()
    .withRoleArn(awsArn) // Use role ARN here
    .withDurationSeconds(s3Properties.getSessionDuration())
    .withRoleSessionName(s3Properties.getAwsSessionname());
```

---

### **Key Fixes**
| Error Cause | Solution |
|-------------|----------|
| Using user ARN instead of role ARN | Use `arn:aws:iam::123456789:role/YourRoleName` |
| Missing `sts:AssumeRole` permission | Attach policy to the user allowing `sts:AssumeRole` on the role |
| Role trust policy not configured | Update role’s trust policy to allow the user to assume it |

---

### **Verification Steps**
1. **Test in AWS CLI**:
   ```bash
   aws sts assume-role --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789:role/S3AccessRole --role-session-name test-session
   ```
2. Check CloudTrail logs for errors if access is still denied.

By configuring the IAM role, trust policy, and user permissions correctly, the Java client will successfully assume the role and access S3. Let me know if you need further help! 🚀

## ChatGPT o1

Below are the key steps to allow a particular IAM user to assume a role using the STS API (sts:AssumeRole). The main problems are:

1. You are referencing your user ARN instead of a **role** ARN in the assumeRole call. You can only assume roles, not users.
2. Your user must have a policy that explicitly allows them to call sts:AssumeRole on that role.
3. The role’s trust policy must trust the user’s AWS account or the specific IAM user/role that is making the call.

---

## 1) Create or Identify an IAM Role
You must have a valid AWS IAM role to assume. Its ARN must look like:
```
arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/<MyRoleName>
```
not a user ARN (which would be `...:user/xyz`). If you don’t have such a role yet:

1. In the AWS IAM console, choose “Roles” → “Create role”.
2. Under “Trusted entity type”, select “AWS account”.
3. Under “An AWS account”, choose “Another AWS account” and enter your own Account ID, or pick “Same account” if you want to trust the same account.  
   - Alternatively, you can set it to trust a specific principal later in the JSON trust policy.
4. Attach any needed permissions policy to the role (what you want the role to be able to do, e.g. “AmazonS3FullAccess”).
5. Give it a name, e.g. “MyTestRole”, and finish creation.

Copy the role’s ARN, which will look like:
```
arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyTestRole
```

---

## 2) Allow the User to Call `sts:AssumeRole` on That Role
Your user “test-key” needs an IAM policy that grants them `sts:AssumeRole` on the role ARN. For example, attach a policy to the user with JSON like:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyTestRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

(This can be either inline or managed; just ensure the user has it.)

---

## 3) Edit the Role’s Trust Policy to Trust That User
Now the **role** must trust the user’s principal so that the user can assume it. In the IAM console, open the “MyTestRole” role, then under “Trust relationships” (the role trust policy), include a statement like:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/test-key"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

This instructs the role to allow `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/test-key` to assume it. You could also allow the entire account, e.g.:

```json
"Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root" }
```
but that’s broader access.

---

## 4) Use the **Role ARN** in Your Java Code
In your code, replace the ARN reference from the user ARN to the role ARN:

```java
// Instead of arn:aws:iam::123456789:user/test-key, use:
String awsArn = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyTestRole";

AssumeRoleRequest assumeRequest = new AssumeRoleRequest()
  .withRoleArn(awsArn)
  .withDurationSeconds(s3Properties.getSessionDuration())
  .withRoleSessionName(s3Properties.getAwsSessionname());

AWSSecurityTokenService stsClient = AWSSecurityTokenServiceClientBuilder.standard()
  .withCredentials(new AWSStaticCredentialsProvider(credentials))
  .withRegion(s3Properties.getAwsRegion())
  .build();

AssumeRoleResult assumeResult = stsClient.assumeRole(assumeRequest);
Credentials credentials2 = assumeResult.getCredentials();
// Now use credentials2 in your S3 client or other AWS clients
```

---

### Summary
- You **cannot** assume a user ARN. You must assume a role ARN.
- The user needs a policy allowing `"sts:AssumeRole"` on the specific role ARN.
- The role needs a trust policy that trusts that user principal.
- Update the code to reference `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/<MyRoleName>` instead of your user ARN.

With these steps, your user `test-key` will be authorized to perform `sts:AssumeRole` on the correct role, and you’ll no longer receive “AccessDenied” when calling STS.

## Analysis 

Note: The five LLMs have been anonymized in the analysis below, as follows: ChatGPT-4o is Chatbot #1, Gemini 2.0 Flash is Chatbot #2, Q is Chatbot #3, DeepSeek R1 is Chatbot #4 and ChatGPT-o1 is Chatbot #5

Below is a comparative analysis of each of the five chatbot responses measured against the **baseline answer** from Stack Overflow:

---

## Baseline Answer (Summary)

A user is trying to call `sts:AssumeRole` from a Java S3 client, but the request fails with an AccessDenied error. The key insight in the baseline answer is that **the user is incorrectly trying to assume an IAM user** instead of an **IAM role**. The baseline specifically says that you must update your code to reference an IAM role ARN (with the correct trust policy and user permission) rather than a user ARN. It references the official docs and clarifies that “AssumeRole” must be invoked against a role, not a user.

## Chatbot Response #1

1. **Accuracy**  
   - #1 mentions that you need to allow an IAM user to assume a role and also need the trust policy set. It clarifies that the user is referencing “arn:aws:iam::123456789:user/test-key” but should be referencing a role.  
   - This matches well with the baseline's diagnosis that you need a role, not a user.  
   **Rating**: **Satisfactory**

2. **Completeness**  
   - #1 describes how to add an IAM policy for the user with "sts:AssumeRole" on the resource, how to set the trust policy, how to ensure the role has S3 perms, etc. The baseline solution is specifically about referencing the correct role ARN, which #1 covers.  
   **Rating**: **Satisfactory**

   - This matches the baseline.  
   **Rating**: **Satisfactory**

2. **Completeness**  
   - #2 covers the trust policy, the user policy, and referencing the correct role ARN. That’s exactly the baseline approach.  
   **Rating**: **Satisfactory**

3. **Clarity**  
   - The explanation is well structured, with “Modify the IAM user’s policy,” “Update the code snippet,” etc.  
   **Rating**: **Satisfactory**

4. **Practicality**  
   - The user can directly follow these steps.  
   **Rating**: **Satisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #2): Satisfactory**

   - Nicely enumerated steps.  
   **Rating**: **Satisfactory**

4. **Practicality**  
   - Quite direct.  
   **Rating**: **Satisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #4): Satisfactory**

---

## Chatbot Response #5

1. **Accuracy**  
   - #5 states the user is referencing a user ARN, but they must specify a role ARN, and that a user must have `sts:AssumeRole` permission, plus the trust policy. 
   - Matches the baseline.  
   **Rating**: **Satisfactory**

2. **Completeness**  
   - Mentions that you can’t assume a user. Also discusses the relevant policies and code changes.

# Summary

All the chatbots except #3 basically say the same thing as the baseline: you must change the code to reference a **role** ARN, not a user ARN, and also fix the trust policy / user policy. The baseline specifically highlights that the user is incorrectly referencing a user ARN. All of #1, #2, #4, #5 do that. #3 is incomplete.

**Overall Best**: #1, #2, #4, #5 are all good.  
**Worst**: #3 (incomplete).
