How to integrate AWS Cognito with API gateway

After going through AWS Cognito documentation I am extremely confused with how it is implemented with API Gateway.

From what I understood, it is very easy to implement user pools with api gateway (just by adding the user pool as an authenticator) but I am confused how identity pools enter the picture here. What use is only authorizing my users on my API gateway with user pools?

So the concrete two questions would be:

How do I use identity pools AND user pools with API Gateway (if possible)

What is the point of only using user pools with API gateway, without identity pools?

## Highest-scored answer 

Amazon Cognito User Pool= OIDC Identity Provider (aka IdP) for you customers. This can handle your sign-up, sign-in, profile management, etc. This can house native users or federate with other social IdPs, SAML IdPs, or OIDC IdPs.

Amazon Cognito Identity Pools= Credential Broker. This essentially allows you to grant access to other AWS services. It integrates seamlessly with a Cognito User Pool (serving as the IdP) or any SAML or OIDC compliant IdP. You're essentially exchanging JWT tokens or SAML assertions for AWS credentials using AWS Security Token Service (STS).

For example, say you had a photo sharing application, you could use a Cognito User pool to sign-up & sign-in users. API Gateway could be used as a proxy to get data from DynamoDB and API Gateway could be used as the authorizer for your users. The photos being uploaded in this simple example could be stored in S3. Your application could now use a Cognito Identity Pool to exchange the User Pool tokens for AWS credentials in order to upload/download the users photos to the specific S3 bucket. Hopefully this very simple example can help.

Integrating AWS Cognito with API Gateway can be a bit confusing, especially when trying to understand the roles of user pools and identity pools. Here’s a detailed explanation to clarify the concepts and answer your questions:

### User Pools vs. Identity Pools

**User Pools**: These are used for authentication. A user pool is a user directory in Amazon Cognito. Users can sign up and sign in to your applications through a user pool. You can use user pools to authenticate and authorize users directly through the API Gateway.

**Identity Pools**: These provide AWS credentials to grant your users access to other AWS services. Identity pools can be used to authorize access to AWS resources (such as S3, DynamoDB) using IAM roles. Identity pools can authenticate users from user pools or other identity providers (like Google, Facebook, etc.).

### Using User Pools with API Gateway

To use user pools with API Gateway, follow these steps:

1. **Create a User Pool** in Amazon Cognito.
2. **Configure the API Gateway** to use the user pool as an authorizer.

**Steps**:
1. **Create a User Pool**:
   - Go to the Amazon Cognito console.
   - Create a new user pool and configure the settings as required.

2. **Configure API Gateway**:
   - Go to the API Gateway console.
   - Create a new API or use an existing one.
   - Under the API, create a new authorizer and select “Cognito”.
   - Configure the authorizer to use your Cognito user pool.
   - Attach this authorizer to the API methods you want to secure.

### Using Identity Pools and User Pools with API Gateway

To use both identity pools and user pools with API Gateway:

1. **Create a User Pool** as described above.
2. **Create an Identity Pool**:
   - Go to the Amazon Cognito console.
   - Create a new identity pool and configure it to use your user pool for authentication.
   - This will create two IAM roles (one for authenticated users and one for unauthenticated users).

3. **Configure API Gateway**:
   - Use the user pool authorizer as described above for authentication.
   - After successful authentication, you can use the identity pool to get AWS credentials and access other AWS services.

### Why Use Identity Pools?

- **AWS Resource Access**: Identity pools are used to grant your users access to AWS resources. For example, if you want your authenticated users to upload files to an S3 bucket, you use identity pools to provide the necessary AWS credentials.
- **Federated Identities**: Identity pools allow you to provide federated identities from other identity providers (Google, Facebook, etc.), which user pools alone do not support.

### Example: Integrating Both with API Gateway

**1. Create a User Pool and Identity Pool**:
   - Follow the steps to create a user pool.
   - Create an identity pool and link it with your user pool.

**2. Configure API Gateway**:
   - Create an authorizer in API Gateway using your user pool.
   - Secure your API methods using this authorizer.

**3. Use Identity Pool in Your Application**:
   - After user authentication using the user pool, obtain AWS credentials using the identity pool.
   - Use these credentials to access other AWS resources.

### Sample Code for Obtaining AWS Credentials

After user signs in using the user pool:

```javascript
// Configure AWS
AWS.config.region = 'YOUR_REGION'; // e.g., us-east-1

// Get the ID token from Cognito User Pool
var cognitoUser = userPool.getCurrentUser();
if (cognitoUser != null) {
    cognitoUser.getSession(function(err, session) {
        if (err) {
            console.log(err);
            return;
        }
        console.log('session validity: ' + session.isValid());

        // Get AWS credentials
        AWS.config.credentials = new AWS.CognitoIdentityCredentials({
            IdentityPoolId: 'YOUR_IDENTITY_POOL_ID',
            Logins: {
                'cognito-idp.YOUR_REGION.amazonaws.com/YOUR_USER_POOL_ID': session.getIdToken().getJwtToken()
            }
        });

        // Make the call to obtain credentials
        AWS.config.credentials.get(function(){
            console.log("AWS Credentials:", AWS.config.credentials);
        });
    });
}
```

### Conclusion

- **User Pools**: Use for authentication with API Gateway.
- **Identity Pools**: Use for granting access to AWS resources after authentication.

By understanding these differences and how to implement both, you can build a secure and scalable solution using AWS Cognito and API Gateway.


## ChatGPT-4

Integrating AWS Cognito with API Gateway can be a bit tricky, especially when distinguishing the roles and uses of User Pools and Identity Pools. Here’s a detailed explanation to clarify your questions and provide guidance on how to integrate both with API Gateway.

### Understanding User Pools and Identity Pools

1. **User Pools** are user directories that provide sign-up and sign-in options for app users. User Pools manage user and authentication data and can allow users to authenticate directly against Cognito. When integrated with API Gateway, a User Pool primarily handles authentication (i.e., verifying user credentials).

2. **Identity Pools (Federated Identities)** provide AWS credentials to users so they can access AWS services directly. Identity Pools support authentication through various providers, including Cognito User Pools, social identity providers (like Google, Facebook, Amazon), and SAML-based identity providers. They help authorize users to access other AWS services.

### Integrating Cognito User Pools with API Gateway

To use User Pools with API Gateway for authenticating API calls:

1. **Set Up a Cognito User Pool**:
   - Create a user pool in Cognito if you haven’t already.
   - Define app clients in the user pool.

2. **Configure API Gateway**:
   - Create or select your API in API Gateway.
   - For each method you want to protect, choose the **Method Request**.
   - Under the **Authorization settings**, select **Cognito User Pool** as the **Authorization type**.
   - Choose the appropriate Cognito User Pool, and set the Authorization Scope if necessary.

This setup allows the API Gateway to handle incoming requests by validating the OAuth tokens against the specified User Pool. Users must sign in to your user pool and obtain a token, which they include in the API requests.

### Integrating Cognito Identity Pools with API Gateway

To use Identity Pools for accessing AWS services through API Gateway:

1. **Set Up an Identity Pool**:
   - Create an Identity Pool in Cognito and enable access to unauthenticated identities if needed.
   - Associate the Identity Pool with your User Pool under Authentication providers.

2. **Assign IAM Roles**:
   - Define IAM roles for authenticated and possibly unauthenticated users. Specify these roles in the Identity Pool configuration.
   - These roles define the permissions for the API actions that users can invoke directly.

3. **Use AWS IAM Authentication in API Gateway**:
   - Instead of selecting a Cognito User Pool as the authorizer in API Gateway, use **AWS IAM** as the authorization type.
   - This requires clients to sign their API requests with AWS Signature Version 4.

In this setup, users authenticate via the User Pool, and Identity Pools grant them temporary AWS credentials. These credentials are used to sign API requests, which allows API Gateway to authorize requests based on IAM policies.

### Why Use Only User Pools?

Using just User Pools with API Gateway is common for APIs that don't need to interact with other AWS services on behalf of the user. It simplifies the architecture by handling authentication without dealing with AWS resource access, which is suitable for applications strictly serving HTTP API requests based on user identity.

### Conclusion

The choice between using User Pools alone or in conjunction with Identity Pools depends on your application's needs. If your APIs need to interact with AWS services (like accessing S3 buckets or DynamoDB tables), integrating both User Pools and Identity Pools with API Gateway is beneficial. If your use case is primarily about managing user authentication for API access, then User Pools alone might suffice.

You're right, the distinction between User Pools and Identity Pools in the context of AWS Cognito and API Gateway can be confusing. Here's a breakdown to clarify their roles:
User Pools vs. Identity Pools with API Gateway:
User Pools:


Used for user registration, sign-in, and authentication.
Create a directory of users with username/password or social login.
Integrate with API Gateway using a Cognito authorizer. This validates user tokens issued by the User Pool and allows access control based on user identity.
Ideal for scenarios where you need fine-grained authorization based on user attributes or groups within the User Pool.
Identity Pools:


Used for providing temporary, anonymous, or federated identities to users accessing your API.
Enable authentication with providers like Facebook, Google, Amazon, or custom providers (e.g., SAML).
Integrate with API Gateway using IAM roles. You assign IAM permissions to an Identity Pool and map users from different identity providers to specific IAM roles. API Gateway then validates the user's identity token and grants access based on the assigned IAM role's permissions.
Ideal for scenarios where you require a simpler authentication flow or don't need user registration/management features.
Using User Pools and Identity Pools Together (if applicable):
While not always necessary, you can combine User Pools and Identity Pools:
Users log in to your User Pool (using username/password or social login).
Upon successful login, the User Pool generates a token and potentially additional information about the user.
Your application exchanges the User Pool token for temporary credentials from the Identity Pool.
The temporary credentials are used to authenticate with API Gateway and grant access based on the user's attributes or assigned IAM role through the Identity Pool.
This approach provides a more flexible authentication flow, but it might be more complex to set up and manage.
When to Use User Pools Only:
User Pools are sufficient for API Gateway authorization if:
You require user registration and management.
You need fine-grained control based on user attributes or groups within the User Pool.
You don't need to integrate with external identity providers like Facebook or Google.
In Summary:
Choose User Pools for user registration/management and fine-grained authorization in API Gateway.
Choose Identity Pools for simpler authentication flows without user management or for federated logins.
Consider combining them for specific use cases requiring both functionalities.
