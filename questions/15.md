How to retrieve cloudwatch metrics older than 3 hours

I try to work with custom CloudWatch Metrics. Pushing metrics thorugh aws-go-sdk-v2 works fine but I have an issue working with the metrics in the web UI. My workload only runs every once every 24h but in the web ui I can only query for metrics in the last 3h hours it seems.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch-metrics-insights-limits.html also says Currently, you can query only the most recent three hours of data.

Do I have to post process the data somehow to get a historical view of the data? Since I can set the graph to 1w time window I suspect there must be a way to achieve this. Any ideas what I am missing?


## Highest-scored answer 

If you need to retrieve your metrics using CloudWatch Metrics Insights, please note that currently we only support receiving no more than 3 hours of your data.

Since you need to search metric names and retrieve data for an interval longer than 3 hours, I would recommend using the regular search syntax, or plot your metrics individually.

## ChatGPT 4o

To retrieve and view CloudWatch metrics older than 3 hours in the AWS Management Console, you can use the standard CloudWatch metrics functionality instead of CloudWatch Metrics Insights, which has the limitation of querying only the most recent three hours of data.

Here are some steps and methods to help you retrieve and view CloudWatch metrics over a longer time range:

### 1. Using the CloudWatch Console

1. **Open CloudWatch Console**:
   - Go to the [Amazon CloudWatch Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/).

2. **Navigate to Metrics**:
   - In the left-hand navigation pane, click on **Metrics**.

3. **Select Your Namespace**:
   - Select the namespace where your custom metrics are stored. This might be something like `CustomMetrics` or any other name you assigned.

4. **Select Your Metric**:
   - Click on the metric name to view its details.

5. **Adjust the Time Range**:
   - At the top right of the graph, you can select a time range. By default, it might be set to 3 hours, but you can change it to a longer duration such as 1 day, 1 week, or a custom time range by clicking on the time range selector.

### 2. Using CloudWatch Dashboards

Creating a CloudWatch Dashboard can help you visualize metrics over a longer period:

1. **Create a Dashboard**:
   - In the CloudWatch console, go to **Dashboards** and click **Create dashboard**.

2. **Add Widgets**:
   - Add widgets to your dashboard that display your custom metrics.
   - Configure each widget to display data over a desired time range, such as 1 day, 1 week, or a custom time range.

### 3. Using AWS CLI

You can also retrieve historical metrics using the AWS CLI:

```sh
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --namespace <YourNamespace> --metric-name <YourMetricName> --start-time <StartTime> --end-time <EndTime> --period <Period> --statistics Average
```

Replace `<YourNamespace>`, `<YourMetricName>`, `<StartTime>`, `<EndTime>`, and `<Period>` with your specific details. For example:

```sh
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --namespace CustomMetrics --metric-name MyCustomMetric --start-time 2023-05-25T00:00:00Z --end-time 2023-05-28T00:00:00Z --period 3600 --statistics Average
```

### 4. Using CloudWatch Logs Insights (for logs)

If you are dealing with CloudWatch Logs and want to query logs data, you can use CloudWatch Logs Insights:

1. **Open CloudWatch Logs Insights**:
   - In the CloudWatch console, click on **Logs Insights**.

2. **Select Log Group**:
   - Choose the log group that contains your logs.

3. **Run a Query**:
   - Use a query to fetch logs over a longer time range. You can adjust the time range selector in the Logs Insights interface.

### 5. Automating Data Export

You can also export your CloudWatch metrics to other AWS services for longer-term storage and analysis, such as:

- **Export to S3**: Use CloudWatch to export logs to S3 and then process or analyze the logs using tools like Amazon Athena.
- **AWS Data Pipeline or Glue**: Use these services to automate the export and transformation of CloudWatch data.

### Example Using AWS SDK (Go)

Hereâ€™s a brief example of how you might use the AWS SDK for Go to fetch historical metrics:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "time"

    "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws"
    "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config"
    "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/cloudwatch"
)

func main() {
    cfg, err := config.LoadDefaultConfig(context.TODO(), config.WithRegion("us-west-2"))
    if err != nil {
        panic("unable to load SDK config, " + err.Error())
    }

    svc := cloudwatch.NewFromConfig(cfg)

    input := &cloudwatch.GetMetricStatisticsInput{
        Namespace:  aws.String("CustomMetrics"),
        MetricName: aws.String("MyCustomMetric"),
        StartTime:  aws.Time(time.Now().AddDate(0, 0, -7)), // 7 days ago
        EndTime:    aws.Time(time.Now()),
        Period:     aws.Int32(3600),
        Statistics: []cloudwatch.Statistic{cloudwatch.StatisticAverage},
    }

    result, err := svc.GetMetricStatistics(context.TODO(), input)
    if err != nil {
        panic("failed to get metrics, " + err.Error())
    }

    fmt.Println("Metric Data:", result)
}
```

By following these methods, you should be able to view and analyze your CloudWatch metrics over a longer period than the default three hours.


## ChatGPT-4

It seems like there is some confusion about how to retrieve and visualize CloudWatch metrics, especially when you are working with custom metrics that update infrequently, like once every 24 hours. The limitation you're referring to specifically applies to CloudWatch Metrics Insights, which is a feature designed for ad hoc querying of recent metric data. Here are several ways to view and work with older CloudWatch metrics:

### 1. Using CloudWatch Metrics Console
For visualizing older metrics directly within the AWS Management Console:

- **Navigate to the CloudWatch Console**: Go to the CloudWatch service in your AWS Management Console.
- **Access Metrics**: Click on "Metrics" in the sidebar.
- **Select the Namespace**: Choose the appropriate namespace where your custom metrics are stored.
- **Select Metric**: Find and select the metric you are interested in.
- **Adjust the Time Period**: You can adjust the time period for the graph to view older data. AWS CloudWatch stores metric data for up to 15 months, depending on the storage resolution. You can set the graph to display a time window of up to one week or even custom ranges that span several months.

### 2. CloudWatch API or AWS SDKs
If you need to retrieve metrics programmatically:

- **Use the `GetMetricData` or `GetMetricStatistics` API calls**. These allow you to specify a custom time period for your queries, which can be as far back as the data retention period allows.
- **Example with AWS SDK for Go**:
  ```go
  svc := cloudwatch.New(sess)

  result, err := svc.GetMetricStatistics(&cloudwatch.GetMetricStatisticsInput{
      Namespace:  aws.String("YourNamespace"),
      MetricName: aws.String("YourMetricName"),
      Period:     aws.Int64(86400), // The granularity of the data points (in seconds)
      StartTime:  aws.Time(time.Now().AddDate(0, 0, -7)), // 7 days ago
      EndTime:    aws.Time(time.Now()),
      Statistics: []*string{
          aws.String("Average"), // Or Minimum, Maximum, Sum, SampleCount
      },
  })
  if err != nil {
      fmt.Println("Error", err)
      return
  }

  fmt.Println("Result", result)
  ```

### 3. CloudWatch Dashboards
To monitor these metrics continuously, consider setting up a CloudWatch Dashboard:

- **Create a new dashboard**: Add graphs that track your custom metrics.
- **Set up the time window**: Customize the dashboard to show data from the last week, month, or another appropriate period.

### 4. Data Export
If you need long-term storage and analysis:

- **Export CloudWatch Logs to S3**: For very long-term storage or compliance, you can export log data (which might include metrics data, depending on your setup) to Amazon S3 and analyze it using Amazon Athena or other tools.

### Conclusion
The key is to ensure you're using the appropriate tool for the type of metric retrieval and analysis you need. For most purposes, directly accessing metrics through the AWS Console or using the CloudWatch API should meet your needs. Remember that while Metrics Insights is useful for real-time data analysis, other CloudWatch tools are better suited for historical data.


## Gemini

The user is correct that CloudWatch Metrics Insights queries in the web UI are limited to the most recent three hours of data. However, there are ways to retrieve and analyze historical CloudWatch metrics older than 3 hours for custom metrics with a period less than 60 seconds:
1. Downloading Historical Data:
Use the AWS CLI or SDK (e.v., aws-go-sdk-v2) to download historical metric data programmatically. These tools allow specifying a wider time range for retrieval.
Command Example (AWS CLI):
Bash
aws cloudwatch get-metric-data --metric-name MyMetric --namespace MyNamespace --start-time "2024-05-27T00:00:00Z" --end-time "2024-05-29T00:00:00Z" --period 3600


2. Amazon CloudWatch Logs:
If your custom metrics have a period less than 60 seconds (high-resolution metrics), consider sending them to CloudWatch Logs instead of directly to CloudWatch Metrics. Logs can retain data for longer durations and allow querying historical data using tools like Amazon Kinesis Firehose or Amazon Elasticsearch Service.
3. Scheduled Queries with Programmatic Processing:
Set up scheduled queries in CloudWatch Logs Insights to retrieve historical data periodically. You can then process and analyze the downloaded data outside of the web UI's 3-hour limit.
Understanding Retention Periods:
CloudWatch retains data for custom metrics based on their period:
Less than 60 seconds: Up to 3 hours (accessible via programmatic methods)
60 seconds (1 minute): Up to 15 days
300 seconds (5 minutes): Up to 63 days
For historical data beyond these retention periods, consider archiving the data to Amazon S3.
Choosing the Right Approach:
The best method depends on your needs, data volume, and desired analysis tools.
Downloading historical data is suitable for infrequent analysis.
CloudWatch Logs is a good option for high-resolution metrics requiring long-term storage and complex analysis.
Scheduled queries with programmatic processing provide flexibility for automated historical data retrieval and analysis.
By understanding these options and CloudWatch data retention policies, the AWS user can access and analyze their historical custom metrics even if they are older than 3 hours.


## Q

To retrieve CloudWatch metrics older than 3 hours, you can use the following approaches:

1. Use the AWS CLI or AWS SDK to call the `GetMetricData` API:
   - The `GetMetricData` API allows you to retrieve historical metric data, including data older than 3 hours.
   - You can use the `StartTime` and `EndTime` parameters to specify the time range for the metric data you want to retrieve.
   - Here's an example using the AWS CLI:

   ```
   aws cloudwatch get-metric-data --metric-data-queries file://metric-data-queries.json --start-time 2023-04-01T00:00:00Z --end-time 2023-04-30T23:59:59Z
   ```

   The `metric-data-queries.json` file would contain the details of the metrics you want to retrieve.

2. Use the CloudWatch Logs Insights feature:
   - CloudWatch Logs Insights allows you to query and analyze your CloudWatch Logs data, including custom metrics.
   - You can use the CloudWatch Logs Insights query language to retrieve historical metric data, even if it's older than 3 hours.
   - To access CloudWatch Logs Insights, go to the CloudWatch console, select the "Logs" service, and then choose "Insights".

3. Implement a custom solution:
   - If the above options don't meet your requirements, you can implement a custom solution to retrieve historical metric data.
   - This could involve storing the metric data in a separate data store (e.g., Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB) and querying it as needed.
   - You can use the AWS SDK or other tools to interact with the data store and retrieve the historical metric data.

Remember that the availability and retention period of CloudWatch metrics may vary depending on the metric type and the AWS region. Refer to the [AWS CloudWatch documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch-metrics-insights-limits.html) for the most up-to-date information on CloudWatch metrics and data retention policies.
