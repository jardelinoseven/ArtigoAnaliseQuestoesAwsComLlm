GetSecretValue, get identity: get credentials: failed to refresh cached credentials

I have a basic Go code like this. Gives me the error:

```
2024/02/21 21:49:15 operation error Secrets Manager: GetSecretValue,
  get identity: get credentials: failed to refresh cached credentials,
  no EC2 IMDS role found, operation error ec2imds: GetMetadata,

```
I've used amazon secret manager for aws-rds, and I'm sure credentials are right



	secretName := "key"
	region := "eu-central-1"

	config, err := config.LoadDefaultConfig(context.TODO(), config.WithRegion(region))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Create Secrets Manager client
	svc := secretsmanager.NewFromConfig(config)

	input := &secretsmanager.GetSecretValueInput{
		SecretId:     aws.String(secretName),
		VersionStage: aws.String("AWSCURRENT"), 
	}

	result, err := svc.GetSecretValue(context.TODO(), input)
	if err != nil {
		// For a list of exceptions thrown, see
		// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/apireference/API_GetSecretValue.html
		log.Fatal(err.Error())
	}

	// Decrypts secret using the associated KMS key.
	var secretMap map[string]string
	json.Unmarshal([]byte(*result.SecretString), &secretMap)

	return secretMap


## Highest-scored answer 

The problem is you don't have AWS credentials saved on your local machine/environment. To do that follow any of these steps: https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/common/documentation/aws_credentials/ and just simply run the code again. I suggest using the CLI option as that worked easily for me.

### **Fixing AWS Secrets Manager Error in Go: "failed to refresh cached credentials, no EC2 IMDS role found"**

Your error message suggests that **AWS SDK for Go is unable to retrieve credentials**, specifically from the **EC2 Instance Metadata Service (IMDS)**. This usually happens in the following scenarios:

1. **No valid AWS credentials provided** – The SDK can't find credentials via environment variables, IAM roles, or the AWS credentials file.
2. **IMDSv2 is required but not used** – Some EC2 instances require IMDSv2 authentication.
3. **IAM role is missing or misconfigured** – If running on EC2, the instance must have an IAM role with `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permissions.
4. **Running locally without AWS credentials** – If running locally, the SDK does not have credentials to authenticate.

---

## **Solution 1: Use Environment Variables for Credentials (For Local Development)**
If you're running this **locally** (not on EC2 or Lambda), you need to **explicitly provide credentials**.

### **Set credentials using environment variables**
```sh
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
export AWS_REGION=eu-central-1
```
Then try running your Go application again.

✅ **Why?** The AWS SDK will use these credentials when calling `GetSecretValue`.

---

## **Solution 2: Check IAM Role Permissions (For EC2 Instances)**
If running on an **EC2 instance**, make sure it has an **IAM role attached**.

### **Steps to Fix:**
1. **Check if your instance has an IAM role attached**
   ```sh
   aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <instance-id> --query "Reservations[].Instances[].IamInstanceProfile"
   ```
   - If **empty**, attach an IAM role.

2. **Attach an IAM role with Secrets Manager permissions**
   ```sh
   aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name YourIAMRole --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/SecretsManagerReadWrite
   ```
   Or create a custom IAM policy:
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:eu-central-1:123456789012:secret:key-*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

✅ **Why?** Without an IAM role, EC2 cannot retrieve credentials via **Instance Metadata Service (IMDS)**.

---

## **Solution 3: Enable IMDSv2 on EC2 (If Required)**
If your EC2 instance **requires IMDSv2** but your AWS SDK is trying to use IMDSv1, you need to enable **IMDSv2 tokens**.

### **Check if IMDSv2 is required**
Run this on your EC2 instance:
```sh
curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token
```
- If it fails, **IMDSv2 is required**.
- Use **IMDSv2 tokens** explicitly:
  ```sh
  TOKEN=`curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600"`
  curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" -v http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
  ```

✅ **Why?** If IMDSv2 is enabled but the AWS SDK is using IMDSv1, credential retrieval will fail.

---

## **Solution 4: Explicitly Set AWS Profile (For Local Development)**
If you use named profiles in `~/.aws/credentials`, explicitly set the profile.

Modify your **Go code**:
```go
config, err := config.LoadDefaultConfig(context.TODO(),
    config.WithRegion(region),
    config.WithSharedConfigProfile("your-profile-name"))
```
Or set the environment variable:
```sh
export AWS_PROFILE=your-profile-name
```

✅ **Why?** If multiple AWS profiles exist, the SDK might not be using the right one.

---

## **Solution 5: Force AWS SDK to Use Static Credentials**
Modify your **Go code** to provide explicit credentials (for testing only):
```go
config, err := config.LoadDefaultConfig(context.TODO(),
    config.WithCredentialsProvider(credentials.NewStaticCredentialsProvider("your-access-key", "your-secret-key", "")))
```
🚨 **Warning:** Do **not** use hardcoded credentials in production.

---

## **Final Checklist**
| **Issue** | **Solution** |
|-----------|-------------|
| Running locally without AWS credentials | Set `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` |
| EC2 instance missing IAM role | Attach IAM role with `SecretsManagerReadWrite` |
| IMDSv2 required but SDK uses IMDSv1 | Enable IMDSv2 tokens manually |
| Multiple AWS profiles exist | Explicitly set `AWS_PROFILE=your-profile-name` |
| Force AWS SDK to use static credentials | Use `WithCredentialsProvider()` (only for debugging) |

---

### **Conclusion**
If you’re running this **locally**, use **Solution 1 (Environment Variables)**.  
If you’re running on **EC2**, ensure **IAM role permissions** are correctly set.

The error message "failed to refresh cached credentials, no EC2 IMDS role found" indicates that your Go code is unable to find the necessary AWS credentials to authenticate with Secrets Manager. Even though you're sure your credentials are right, there are a few common reasons why this might happen:

**1.  No IAM Role for EC2:**

* **Missing Role:** Your EC2 instance might not have an IAM role associated with it. IAM roles provide temporary credentials that allow applications running on the instance to access AWS services.
* **Incorrect Role:** The associated IAM role might not have the necessary permissions to access Secrets Manager.

**2.  IMDSv2 Not Enabled:**

* **IMDSv1 Issues:** Older versions of the Instance Metadata Service (IMDSv1) are vulnerable to certain attacks. AWS recommends using IMDSv2, which requires a session token for enhanced security. Your code or environment might not be configured to use IMDSv2.

**3.  Network Connectivity:**

* **IMDS Access:** Your EC2 instance needs network access to the IMDS endpoint to retrieve credentials. If there are any network restrictions or firewall rules blocking this access, credential retrieval will fail.

**4.  Environment Variables:**

* **Incorrect or Missing Variables:** Your code might be trying to retrieve credentials from environment variables that are not set or are incorrect.

**5.  AWS SDK Configuration:**

* **Shared Credentials File:** The AWS SDK might be looking for credentials in a shared credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`) that doesn't exist or has incorrect credentials.
* **AWS Profile:** You might be using an incorrect AWS profile in your SDK configuration.


**Here's how to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:**

**1. Verify IAM Role:**

* **Go to EC2 Console:** In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the EC2 service.
* **Instances:** Select the EC2 instance where your Go code is running.
* **Check IAM Role:** In the "Description" tab, look for the "IAM role" associated with the instance.
* **Verify Permissions:** Go to the IAM service and check the permissions attached to the role. It should have a policy that allows access to Secrets Manager (e.g., `SecretsManagerReadWrite`).

**2. Enable IMDSv2:**

* **Instance Metadata Service:** In the EC2 console, under "Instance Settings," go to "Instance Metadata Service."
* **Enable IMDSv2:** Ensure that IMDSv2 is enabled for your instance.
* **Configure Hop Limit:** Set the "Hop limit" to 2 or more.

**3. Check Network Connectivity:**

* **Security Groups:** Verify that the security group attached to your EC2 instance allows outbound traffic to the IMDS endpoint ([http://169.254.169.254](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://169.254.169.254)).
* **Network ACLs:** If you're using Network ACLs, ensure they allow outbound traffic to the IMDS endpoint.

**4.  Review Environment Variables:**

* **Inspect Variables:** Check if your code is relying on any environment variables for credentials (e.g., `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`). If so, ensure these variables are correctly set.

**5.  Configure AWS SDK:**

* **Credentials File:** If you're using a shared credentials file, make sure it exists at `~/.aws/credentials` and has the correct credentials for your profile.
* **Profile:** If you're using a specific AWS profile, ensure it's correctly configured in the SDK or as an environment variable (`AWS_PROFILE`).

**6.  Use AWS SDK Credential Providers:**

* **Default Providers Chain:** The AWS SDK for Go has a chain of credential providers that it uses to find credentials.  Ensure that the order of the providers is appropriate for your environment.
* **Explicit Provider:** If needed, explicitly specify the credential provider you want to use in your code (e.g., `credentials.NewEnvCredentials()` for environment variables, `credentials.NewSharedCredentials("", "profile_name")` for a shared credentials file).

**Code Example (with explicit credential provider):**

```go
import (
    // ... other imports ...
    "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws"
    "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config"
    "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/credentials"
    "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/secretsmanager"
)

func getSecret() map[string]string {
    // ... your code ...

    // Explicitly use environment variable credentials
    creds := credentials.NewEnvCredentials() 
    config, err := config.LoadDefaultConfig(context.TODO(), config.WithRegion(region), config.WithCredentialsProvider(creds))
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    // ... rest of your code ...
}
```

By carefully checking these areas, you should be able to identify why your Go code is unable to retrieve credentials and resolve the "failed to refresh cached credentials" error.

To resolve the **"no EC2 IMDS role found"** error when accessing AWS Secrets Manager, follow these steps:

---

### **1. Attach an IAM Role to the EC2 Instance**
The error indicates the EC2 instance lacks an IAM role with permissions to access Secrets Manager.  
- **Create/Update IAM Role**:  
  - **Permissions**: Attach a policy granting `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` on the specific secret.  
    Example policy:  
    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [{
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:eu-central-1:YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:secret:key-*"
      }]
    }
    ```
  - **Attach Role to Instance**:  
    Go to **EC2 Dashboard → Instances → Instance Settings → Attach/Replace IAM Role**.

---

### **2. Verify IMDS (Instance Metadata Service) Accessibility**
The error `context deadline exceeded` suggests the instance cannot reach the IMDS endpoint (`169.254.169.254`).  
- **Check IMDS Status**:  
  ```bash
  curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/
  ```
  - If no role is returned, the instance lacks an IAM role (Step 1).  
  - If the command hangs, check network/firewall rules blocking access to IMDS.  

- **Ensure IMDSv2 is Enabled**:  
  Configure the instance to require IMDSv2:  
  ```bash
  aws ec2 modify-instance-metadata-options \
    --instance-id YOUR_INSTANCE_ID \
    --http-tokens required \
    --http-endpoint enabled \
    --region eu-central-1
  ```

---

### **3. Configure AWS SDK for IMDSv2**
Update your Go code to enforce IMDSv2:  
```go
config, err := config.LoadDefaultConfig(context.TODO(),
  config.WithRegion(region),
  config.WithEC2IMDSv1FallbackDisabled(true), // Force IMDSv2
)
```

---

### **4. Test Locally with Explicit Credentials**
If running outside AWS (e.g., local development), set credentials:  
- **Environment Variables**:  
  ```bash
  export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
  export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
  ```
- **Shared Config File**:  
  Ensure `~/.aws/credentials` contains valid credentials.  

---

### **5. Adjust SDK Timeouts**
Increase the timeout for credential retrieval:  
```go
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 10*time.Second)
defer cancel()

config, err := config.LoadDefaultConfig(ctx, config.WithRegion(region))
```

---

### **6. Check Security Group & Network ACLs**
Ensure the EC2 instance’s security group and subnet NACLs allow outbound traffic to IMDS:  
- **Security Group**: Allow all outbound traffic (default).  
- **Route Tables**: Ensure no routes block `169.254.169.254`.  

---

### **7. Verify Secret ARN and Permissions**
Confirm the secret ARN in your code matches the actual Secrets Manager secret in `eu-central-1` and the attached IAM role has access.

---

### **Final Checks**
1. **Restart the Application**: After attaching the IAM role.  
2. **Test IMDS Access**: Use `curl` to confirm metadata retrieval.  
3. **CloudTrail Logs**: Check for `GetSecretValue` permission denials.  

By addressing IAM roles, IMDS connectivity, and SDK configuration, the error should resolve. Let me know if you need further assistance! 🚀

## ChatGPT o1

Below are common reasons and solutions for the “no EC2 IMDS role found” error when calling `GetSecretValue`. In short, your code is trying to obtain AWS credentials from the EC2 instance metadata service (IMDS), but it either isn’t running on an EC2 instance with an attached IAM role or can’t reach the IMDS for some reason. That triggers the “failed to refresh cached credentials” error. You must explicitly provide valid credentials or run the code in an environment that can fetch credentials (e.g., an EC2/ECS task role).

---

## Why It Happens
1. **Running Outside of EC2** (e.g., local machine, Docker, Lambda) without any credentials environment variables or ~/.aws config file.
2. **EC2 with No IAM Role**: The code sees it’s on an EC2 instance but no role is attached, or the IMDS (metadata service) is unreachable.
3. **IMDSv2 Requirement**: If your instance enforces IMDSv2 but the Go SDK is timing out, you can see similar errors.

---

## Ways to Fix

1. **Supply Credentials in the Environment**  
   Set `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (optionally `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` if using temporary creds) in environment variables:
   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AKIA..."
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="abcd..."
   export AWS_REGION="eu-central-1"
   ```
   Then your Go code with `LoadDefaultConfig` will pick these up automatically.

2. **Use a Shared Config or Credentials File**  
   If you have a standard `~/.aws/credentials` or `~/.aws/config` file:
   ```ini
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = AKIA...
   aws_secret_access_key = abcd...
   region = eu-central-1
   ```
   Then `config.LoadDefaultConfig(context.TODO())` will load them from your default profile automatically.

3. **Run on an EC2 Instance with an Attached IAM Role**  
   - If you’re actually on an EC2 instance, ensure you attach an instance IAM role that has permission to read Secrets Manager.  
   - Check IMDS access. For example, run:
     ```bash
     curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/
     ```
     If that times out or you get an error, you need to allow IMDS in the instance metadata options.  
   - Also confirm your `GetSecretValue` call is allowed by that IAM role’s policy.

4. **ECS Task Role or EKS IRSA**  
   - If running in ECS, define a **task IAM role** that can access Secrets Manager, and the container will automatically retrieve credentials.  
   - If running in EKS, set up IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts) so the pod has credentials.

5. **Check IMDSv2**  
   - If your instance requires IMDSv2 (token-based requests), older AWS SDK versions might fail if they don’t request the session token properly. Update your AWS Go SDK to a recent version.  
   - Or, in the AWS Console under EC2 instance settings, ensure “Metadata accessible” is turned on or set to “optional.”

---

### Example Minimal Policy for Secrets Manager
Make sure the IAM role or user has a policy like:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:eu-central-1:<ACCOUNT_ID>:secret:key-*"
    }
  ]
}
```
(Adjust `Resource` as appropriate, or use `*` for broader access.)

---

#### Summary
To fix “get identity: get credentials: failed to refresh cached credentials, no EC2 IMDS role found,” ensure your Go application can retrieve valid AWS credentials. Either run on an EC2/ECS/EKS environment with a proper IAM role or provide credentials via environment variables or shared config files. Once the SDK can load credentials, your `GetSecretValue` calls should succeed.

## Analysis 

Note: The five LLMs have been anonymized in the analysis below, as follows: ChatGPT-4o is Chatbot #1, Gemini 2.0 Flash is Chatbot #2, Q is Chatbot #3, DeepSeek R1 is Chatbot #4 and ChatGPT-o1 is Chatbot #5

Below is a detailed, comparative analysis of each chatbot response against the **baseline answer** from Stack Overflow.

---

## Baseline Answer (Summary)

The user is receiving:

```
failed to refresh cached credentials,
no EC2 IMDS role found,
operation error ec2imds: GetMetadata,
request canceled, context deadline exceeded
```

… when calling `GetSecretValue` from AWS Secrets Manager in Go. The baseline answer says:

> "You don't have AWS credentials set up in your environment. Provide them, e.g. with `aws configure` or environment variables or an EC2 IAM role. That solves the problem."

Hence, the short solution is: the code can't find credentials. The user must supply valid AWS credentials – for instance, by configuring them locally or ensuring the EC2 instance has the correct IAM role. Then the `GetSecretValue` call will succeed.
