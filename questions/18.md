## [Question 18 (Mar 18, 2024)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78177893/referenceerror-readablestream-is-not-defined-using-puppeteers-page-pdf-on-aw)

ReferenceError: ReadableStream is not defined using Puppeteer's page.pdf() on AWS

I have implemented a PDF download feature in my current project using Puppeteer. I'm hosting the project on AWS with Node 18.

Locally, it works perfectly fine, but in production when I hit the PDF download API, it returns the following error: ` ReferenceError: ReadableStream is not defined`.

Puppeteer version is 22.3.0

Here is the Puppeteer code:

<!-- language: lang-js -->

    public getReportPdf = async(req: Request, res: Response) = >{
      const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
      const page = await browser.newPage();

      try {
        const {
          reportId
        } = req.params;
        const reportData = await this.reportRepo.getJobAndTemplateWithReport(reportId);
        const htmlData = await ejs.renderFile('src/helper/templates/report.ejs', {
          record: reportData[0],
          reportOverview: REPORT_OVERVIEW
        });
        const image = await getBase64Image('https://maxscaffold-front-stg.taskgrids.com/assets/images/Max-Builders-Default.png') // Need to pass here companyLogo url
        await page.setContent(htmlData);
        const pdfBuffer = await page.pdf({
          displayHeaderFooter: true,
          headerTemplate: ` < div style = "font-size: 10px; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin-left: 300px" > <div > Powered by < /div>
            <img style="height: 50px; width: auto; margin-left: 5px" src="data:image/png;
          base64,
          $ {
            image
          }
          "/>
            </div>`,
            format: 'A4',
            printBackground: true,
            preferCSSPageSize: true,
            scale: 0.8,
            margin: {
              top: '100px',
              bottom:'50px'
            }
          });
          await page.close();
          await browser.close();

          const savepath = `./${STORAGE_BUCKET.DEFAULT}/${reportId}_report.pdf`;

          fs.writeFile(savepath, pdfBuffer, (err) => {
            if (err) {
              console.log('err', err);
            }
          });
          setTimeout(() => {
            fs.promises.unlink(savepath);
          }, 25000);

      
          const data = process.env.NODE_URL + `api/images/${reportId}_report.pdf`;
           return generalResponse(req, res,data, successMessage.REPORT_DISPLAY_SUCCESS, true, responseFlag.SUCCESS);
        } catch (error) {
          await page.close();
          await browser.close();
          return generalResponse(req, res, error, errorMessage.SOMETHING_WRONG, false, responseFlag.ERROR);
        }
      };"

Can anyone please help me to resolve this issue?

I have tried Node version 18 locally, then it works perfectly, but I don't know why in production it gives an error.

## ChatGPT 4o

### **Fixing "ReferenceError: ReadableStream is not defined" in Puppeteer on AWS**
Your error:
```
ReferenceError: ReadableStream is not defined
```
occurs because **AWS Lambda and certain AWS EC2 environments (especially Amazon Linux 2 and older) do not support `ReadableStream` in Node.js 18+** by default. **Puppeteer 22.3.0** relies on `ReadableStream`, but the execution environment is missing support.

---

## **Solutions**
### **Solution 1: Ensure You're Using Node.js 18 Runtime with `fetch` API Support**
AWS environments, especially **Lambda or older EC2 AMIs**, might be missing the **WHATWG Streams API** (`ReadableStream`).

1. **Check Node.js version in AWS**
   ```sh
   node -v
   ```
   If it’s not `v18.x`, upgrade it.

2. **Ensure AWS Lambda or EC2 instance is using Node.js 18**
   - In **Lambda**, go to **Runtime settings** → Select `Node.js 18.x`.
   - In **EC2**, update Node.js:
     ```sh
     nvm install 18
     nvm use 18
     ```

✅ **Why?**  
Older **Amazon Linux 2** does not support `ReadableStream` even on **Node.js 18**, so upgrading may not be enough.

---

### **Solution 2: Polyfill `ReadableStream` Manually**
If upgrading Node.js does not fix the issue, polyfill `ReadableStream` using `stream/web`.

1. **Modify the top of your Puppeteer file:**
   ```js
   import { ReadableStream } from 'stream/web';

   if (!global.ReadableStream) {
       global.ReadableStream = ReadableStream;
   }
   ```

✅ **Why?**  
`stream/web` is available in **Node.js 18+**, and this ensures Puppeteer finds `ReadableStream`.

---

### **Solution 3: Install `puppeteer` Instead of `puppeteer-core`**
You're using `puppeteer-core`, which **does not bundle Chromium**. On AWS, this can cause compatibility issues.

1. **Uninstall `puppeteer-core`**
   ```sh
   npm uninstall puppeteer-core
   ```
2. **Install full `puppeteer` package**
   ```sh
   npm install puppeteer
   ```

✅ **Why?**  
Puppeteer requires **a compatible Chromium version**; `puppeteer-core` expects you to provide your own, which may not be compatible.

---

### **Solution 4: Use `--disable-dev-shm-usage` Flag for AWS Environments**
Modify Puppeteer’s launch options to use a **headless mode that works in AWS**.

```js
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  args: [
    "--no-sandbox",
    "--disable-setuid-sandbox",
    "--disable-dev-shm-usage",
    "--disable-gpu"
  ]
});
```

✅ **Why?**  
Some AWS environments limit `/dev/shm` (shared memory), which can cause Puppeteer failures.

---

### **Solution 5: Use a Puppeteer-Compatible Lambda Layer (For AWS Lambda)**
If running in **AWS Lambda**, you need a compatible **Puppeteer Lambda layer**.

1. **Use a prebuilt Puppeteer Lambda layer**  
   ```sh
   npm install chrome-aws-lambda puppeteer-core
   ```

2. **Modify Puppeteer launch for Lambda**
   ```js
   import chromium from 'chrome-aws-lambda';

   const browser = await chromium.puppeteer.launch({
       args: chromium.args,
       defaultViewport: chromium.defaultViewport,
       executablePath: await chromium.executablePath,
       headless: chromium.headless
   });
   ```

✅ **Why?**  
AWS Lambda does **not allow Chromium downloads**, so using **chrome-aws-lambda** ensures compatibility.

---

## **Final Recommendation**
| **Fix** | **When to Use?** | **Command/Code** |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| **Upgrade to Node.js 18+** | If running old Node.js | `nvm install 18 && nvm use 18` |
| **Polyfill `ReadableStream`** | If missing in AWS environment | Add `import { ReadableStream } from 'stream/web';` |
| **Use full `puppeteer` package** | If `puppeteer-core` is causing issues | `npm install puppeteer` |
| **Add Puppeteer launch flags** | If running on AWS EC2 | Modify `puppeteer.launch({ args: [...] })` |
| **Use `chrome-aws-lambda`** | If using AWS Lambda | `npm install chrome-aws-lambda puppeteer-core` |

Try **Solution 1 (Upgrade Node.js)** first. If that doesn’t work, use **Solution 2 (Polyfill ReadableStream)**.

The error "ReferenceError: ReadableStream is not defined" when using Puppeteer's `page.pdf()` on AWS Lambda (or similar serverless environments) typically indicates a problem with the Node.js runtime environment's compatibility with the Chromium version used by Puppeteer. Here's a breakdown of the issue and how to resolve it:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **`ReadableStream` and Node.js:** `ReadableStream` is a Web API that is relatively new to Node.js. It's used for handling streaming data. Older Node.js versions or certain build configurations might not fully support it.
* **Puppeteer and Chromium:** Puppeteer relies on Chromium, and newer Chromium versions often use `ReadableStream` internally.
* **AWS Lambda Environment:** AWS Lambda's execution environment has specific Node.js runtimes, and the configuration can sometimes lead to issues with newer Web APIs.

**Possible Solutions**

1.  **Update Node.js Runtime (If Possible):**
    * Ensure you are using the latest Node.js 18.x runtime available on AWS Lambda (or your AWS service). AWS regularly updates its runtimes, and newer versions may have better `ReadableStream` support.
    * If you have the option upgrade to Node.js 20.x, that is even better.

2.  **Use a Puppeteer Layer with a Compatible Chromium:**
    * AWS Lambda requires a headless Chromium to generate PDFs. While Puppeteer can download Chromium automatically locally, this doesn't work in Lambda.
    * Use a pre-built AWS Lambda layer that includes a compatible Chromium version. There are many available online. Some common options include:
        * **`chrome-aws-lambda`:** This library is very popular and provides a pre-configured Chromium for AWS Lambda. It also includes polyfills for missing Web APIs.
        * How to use it.
            * Install the `chrome-aws-lambda` package: `npm install chrome-aws-lambda`
            * Modify your Puppeteer launch code:

        ```javascript
        const chromium = require('chrome-aws-lambda');
        const puppeteer = chromium.puppeteer;

        public getReportPdf = async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
            let browser = null;
            let page = null;
            try {
                browser = await puppeteer.launch({
                    args: chromium.args,
                    defaultViewport: chromium.defaultViewport,
                    executablePath: await chromium.executablePath,
                    headless: chromium.headless,
                });
                page = await browser.newPage();
                // ... rest of your code ...
            } catch (error) {
                console.error(error);
                if (page) await page.close();
                if (browser) await browser.close();
                return generalResponse(req, res, error, errorMessage.SOMETHING_WRONG, false, responseFlag.ERROR);
            } finally{
                if (page) await page.close();
                if (browser) await browser.close();
            }
        };
        ```
    * Deploy the `chrome-aws-lambda` layer with your Lambda function.

3.  **Check for Node.js Build Issues:**
    * If you're building your Node.js application in a specific environment, ensure that the build process is compatible with the AWS Lambda runtime. Sometimes, native dependencies or build flags can cause issues.

4.  **Error handling improvements:**
    * The provided code has some flaws in the error handling. The browser and the page should be closed inside of a finally block to assure that they are always closed, even when an error occurs. I have added this into the example code above.
    * It is also good practice to log the full error object, and not just error.

5.  **Debugging in AWS:**
    * Use CloudWatch Logs to get detailed error messages and debug your Lambda function.
    * If possible, use AWS SAM Local or similar tools to simulate the Lambda environment locally for debugging.

**Key Takeaways**

* The `chrome-aws-lambda` library is the most common and effective solution for using Puppeteer on AWS Lambda.
* Ensure your Node.js runtime is up to date.
* Pay close attention to error handling and logging.

By using the `chrome-aws-lambda` package, you will most likely solve the `ReadableStream` error.

To resolve the **`ReferenceError: ReadableStream is not defined`** error when using Puppeteer's `page.pdf()` on AWS, follow these steps:

---

### **1. Polyfill `ReadableStream` in Node.js**
Install the [`web-streams-polyfill`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-streams-polyfill) package to add `ReadableStream` support to Node.js:
```bash
npm install web-streams-polyfill
```

**Add the polyfill at the top of your Puppeteer code file**:
```javascript
// Add this BEFORE importing puppeteer
import { ReadableStream } from "web-streams-polyfill/ponyfill";
(globalThis as any).ReadableStream = ReadableStream;
```

---

### **2. Configure Puppeteer for AWS Lambda**
AWS Lambda environments often lack Chrome dependencies. Use `puppeteer-core` with a pre-installed Chromium binary:
```javascript
import puppeteer from "puppeteer-core";

const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  executablePath: "/opt/chromium", // Path to Chromium in Lambda layer
  args: ["--no-sandbox", "--disable-setuid-sandbox"],
});
```

---

### **3. Verify AWS Lambda Layer Dependencies**
Ensure your Lambda layer includes:
- **Chromium binary**: Precompiled for AWS Lambda (use [this guide](https://github.com/shelfio/chrome-aws-lambda-layer)).
- **System libraries**: Required for headless Chrome (e.g., `libnss3`, `libgbm`).

---

### **4. Update Puppeteer and Dependencies**
Use the latest Puppeteer version and ensure compatibility with Node.js 18:
```bash
npm install puppeteer@latest
```

---

### **5. Test Locally with AWS-like Conditions**
Replicate the AWS environment locally using Docker:
```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/var/task lambci/lambda:nodejs18.x
```

---

### **Why This Happens**
- **Node.js Limitation**: `ReadableStream` is a browser API and not natively available in Node.js.
- **Puppeteer Dependency**: Puppeteer’s PDF generation relies on `ReadableStream`, which fails in server environments without polyfills.

---

### **Final Checks**
1. **Lambda Permissions**: Ensure the execution role has `logs:CreateLogGroup`, `logs:CreateLogStream`, and `logs:PutLogEvents`.
2. **Memory/Timeout**: Increase Lambda memory (≥ 2048 MB) and timeout (≥ 30 seconds) for PDF generation.
3. **Cleanup**: Close the browser properly to avoid zombie processes:
   ```javascript
   await browser.close();
   ```

By polyfilling `ReadableStream` and configuring Puppeteer for AWS, the error should resolve. Let me know if you need further assistance! 🚀

## ChatGPT o1

Below are the main reasons why you see “ReferenceError: ReadableStream is not defined” in Puppeteer on AWS, plus some workarounds. Although Node.js 18+ does include a global `ReadableStream` in most environments, certain AWS builds or container configurations may lack that global or run an older runtime underneath. You need either to ensure you’re truly on a Node 18+ environment with Web Streams support, or to polyfill `ReadableStream` so Puppeteer can call `page.pdf()` without error.

---

## Why It Happens

1. **Puppeteer >= v20 relies on Web Streams**:  
   Newer Puppeteer versions expect the Node environment to have global `ReadableStream`, which in theory arrived in Node 18. However, some AWS environments, especially older Amazon Linux builds or custom Docker images, may not yet expose the global Web Streams API.

2. **AWS Lambda / ECS / EC2 might not match “Node 18”**:  
   - Even if your function is configured for Node 18, the actual environment might be missing some Web Streams features.  
   - If you’re bundling or shipping your code in a Docker container, the base image might be older than Node 18 or missing certain experimental flags.

---

## Ways to Fix It

### 1) Ensure You’re Actually on a Web-Streams–Enabled Node 18+ Runtime

- **If you’re using AWS Lambda**:  
  - Double-check that the “Runtime” is set to “Node.js 18.x” in the Lambda console.  
  - Confirm you’re not inadvertently deploying a custom or older Node build.  
- **If you’re using Docker**:  
  - In your Dockerfile, make sure `FROM node:18` (or `node:20`) is truly pulling a recent official image.  
  - Confirm your environment is up-to-date. You can run `node -v` in the container to confirm.

If your environment is truly Node 18+ with all features, Puppeteer’s usage of `ReadableStream` should just work without error.

---

### 2) Polyfill Web Streams in Node

If you cannot upgrade or the environment is missing the global `ReadableStream`, you can polyfill it. The most common approach is using [web-streams-polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-streams-polyfill).

**Steps**:

1. **Install**:
   ```bash
   npm install --save web-streams-polyfill
   ```
2. **Import or require** the polyfill before you use Puppeteer:
   ```js
   // at the top of your entry file (e.g., index.js or app.js)
   import 'web-streams-polyfill/ponyfill';
   // or
   require('web-streams-polyfill/ponyfill');
   ```
3. **Run** your Puppeteer code as normal. The polyfill injects a global `ReadableStream`.

This ensures calls like `page.pdf()` that rely on Node’s Web Streams will work.

---

### 3) Downgrade Puppeteer (Short-Term Hack)

If you just need a quick fix, you can revert to a Puppeteer version that doesn’t require Web Streams. For instance, **Puppeteer 19.7.5** or older might not trigger the “ReadableStream is not defined” error.

In your `package.json`:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "puppeteer": "19.7.5"
  }
}
```
Then run `npm install` again. This is less ideal, as you lose newer Puppeteer features and security patches. But it can help as a temporary workaround.

---

### 4) Use Chrome AWS Lambda / Headless Chrome Alternatives

If you’re packaging Puppeteer in a Lambda environment, you might consider the specialized [chrome-aws-lambda](https://github.com/alixaxel/chrome-aws-lambda) or headless Chrome layers that are tested with AWS. Some of those distributions handle a known stable Node version and include the correct patches or polyfills by default. However, these are typically maintained by the community and might be behind on Puppeteer versions.

---

## Summary

To solve “`ReferenceError: ReadableStream is not defined`” in Puppeteer on AWS:

1. **Confirm** you truly have Node 18+ in production (no hidden older version).  
2. **Polyfill** Web Streams if your environment’s Node runtime is missing them:  
   ```bash
   npm install web-streams-polyfill
   ```
   ```js
   import 'web-streams-polyfill/ponyfill';
   ```  
3. **Or** temporarily **downgrade Puppeteer** to a version that doesn’t require `ReadableStream`.  

Once your environment provides or polyfills `ReadableStream`, `page.pdf()` in Puppeteer should run normally.

## Baseline Answer (Summary)

The user is seeing the error **`ReferenceError: ReadableStream is not defined`** when calling `page.pdf()` in Puppeteer on AWS (Node.js 18 environment). The **baseline answer** says:

> The likely root cause is that the environment lacks support for `ReadableStream`. You need to ensure that your Node version / environment truly has the `ReadableStream` global (which is introduced in Node 18+). Possibly the user must:
> 1. Upgrade Node.js to a version that includes `ReadableStream` by default, or
> 2. Use a polyfill for `ReadableStream`.
> 3. And/or ensure the code is using a fully compatible Puppeteer + Node environment so that `ReadableStream` calls in Puppeteer’s `page.pdf()` work.

Hence, the solution is either to confirm that Node 18 is actually used – with the Web Streams features included – or to add a polyfill for `ReadableStream` if it’s missing in the AWS environment.
