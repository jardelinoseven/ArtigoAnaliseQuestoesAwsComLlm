## [Question 20 (Jan 30, 2024)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77909236/chromium-issue-with-error-initializing-nss-with-a-peristent-database-nss-error-c)

Chromium issue with Error initializing NSS with a peristent database NSS error code: -8023

We wrote a Print PDF lambda function generates a PDF file using puppeteer from HTML content sent to it in the SQS message.  It is deployed as a lambda in aws. The function also allows uploading of pictures.  The pdf is then stored in a s3 bucket. We are using chrome-aws-lambda and puppeteer. (chrome-aws-lambda@8.0.2 puppeteer-core@8.0.0). When we tried to upload pictures we are getting following:
 

    error: Error initializing NSS with a persistent database  NSS error code: -8023.

It is then followed by 

    ERROR      Invoke Error       {
        "errorType": "Error",
        "errorMessage": "Navigation failed because browser has disconnected!",
        "stack": [

        ]
    } 

 A pdf file with "access denied" is then created in s3 bucket.  Please advise and recommendation a solution.




## Baseline answer 

AWS silently updated Node version for Lambdas.

You can update the package and Node version or you can just disable auto update runtime version and lock it. I'm using v18.18 and it's working fine again.

### **Fixing Chromium "Error initializing NSS with a persistent database" in AWS Lambda (Puppeteer)**
Your issue is caused by **Chromium failing to initialize the NSS (Network Security Services) database**, which is required for handling **secure connections and image uploads** in Puppeteer.

This typically happens in **AWS Lambda** due to:
1. **Lack of persistent storage (`/home/user/.pki` is not writable in Lambda)**
2. **Missing necessary Chromium dependencies**
3. **Lambda memory or execution time limits causing Puppeteer crashes**
4. **Incompatible Puppeteer and Chrome versions**

---

## **Solution 1: Use the Correct Puppeteer Launch Flags**
Modify your Puppeteer **launch options** to **disable NSS database loading** and prevent crashes.

```js
const chromium = require("chrome-aws-lambda");
const puppeteer = require("puppeteer-core");

async function generatePDF(htmlContent) {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    args: [
      "--no-sandbox",
      "--disable-setuid-sandbox",
      "--disable-dev-shm-usage",
      "--disable-gpu",
      "--single-process",
      "--no-zygote",
      "--disable-software-rasterizer",
      "--disable-extensions",
      "--disable-features=site-per-process",
      "--disable-background-networking",
      "--disable-default-apps",
      "--disable-sync",
      "--disable-translate",
      "--no-first-run",
      "--mute-audio",
      "--font-render-hinting=none",
      "--remote-debugging-port=9222",
      "--disable-background-timer-throttling",
      "--disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows",
      "--disable-breakpad",
      "--disable-component-extensions-with-background-pages",
      "--disable-dev-tools",
      "--disable-ipc-flooding-protection",
      "--disable-renderer-backgrounding",
      "--enable-automation",
      "--export-tagged-pdf",
      "--no-service-autorun",
      "--disable-print-preview",
      "--font-config-match=ignore",
      "--ignore-certificate-errors",
      "--ignore-urlfetcher-cert-requests",
      "--ignore-certificate-errors-spki-list",
      "--disable-setuid-sandbox",
      "--disable-crash-reporter",
      "--disable-nacl",
      "--disable-remote-fonts",
    ],
    executablePath: await chromium.executablePath,
    headless: true,
  });

  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.setContent(htmlContent);
  const pdfBuffer = await page.pdf({ format: "A4" });

  await browser.close();
  return pdfBuffer;
}
```

✅ **Why?**
- The `--disable-setuid-sandbox` and `--no-sandbox` prevent Chromium from attempting to use **restricted directories**.
- The `--disable-dev-shm-usage` prevents crashes due to Lambda’s limited `/dev/shm`.
- The `--disable-gpu`, `--disable-software-rasterizer`, and `--disable-features=site-per-process` prevent graphics issues that cause Puppeteer to crash.

---

## **Solution 2: Increase Lambda Memory & Timeout**
If Puppeteer crashes, Lambda might **lack enough memory or time** to process images.

### **Increase Memory Allocation**
- Go to **AWS Lambda → Functions** → Select your function → Edit **Memory**.
- Set **Memory: at least 1024MB** (preferably **2048MB** for image-heavy PDFs).

### **Increase Timeout**
- Under **Configuration → General Settings**, set:
  - **Timeout**: `120 seconds` (instead of default 3 seconds).

✅ **Why?**  
- Large images and PDFs require **more memory**.
- Increasing timeout ensures Puppeteer has time to process images.

---

## **Solution 3: Upgrade to the Latest `chrome-aws-lambda` and `puppeteer-core` Versions**
Older versions of `chrome-aws-lambda` and `puppeteer-core` can be **incompatible with newer AWS environments**.

### **Upgrade Dependencies**
```sh
npm uninstall puppeteer-core chrome-aws-lambda
npm install puppeteer-core@latest chrome-aws-lambda@latest
```

✅ **Why?**
- Newer versions improve **AWS Lambda compatibility**.
- Fixes issues related to **missing libraries**.

---

## **Solution 4: Add Missing Chromium Dependencies**
AWS Lambda **does not have all the necessary system libraries** for Puppeteer by default. Ensure your Lambda **has the required dependencies**.

### **Use a Lambda Layer with Chromium Dependencies**
If you’re using AWS Lambda, add the missing libraries via a **Lambda layer**.

1. Download a **prebuilt Chromium layer** from AWS Lambda:
   - Visit **https://github.com/shelfio/chrome-aws-lambda-layer**
   - Deploy the **Lambda layer ARN** for your AWS region.

2. Add the Layer to Your Lambda:
   - **Go to AWS Lambda → Layers** → **Add Layer** → Select **custom layer**.
   - Attach **shelfio's Chrome Lambda layer**.

✅ **Why?**  
- **Fixes missing libraries** that cause `NSS error -8023`.
- Works **without modifying Puppeteer code**.

---

## **Solution 5: Use `sandbox` Mode for Local Testing**
If you’re testing locally and **only seeing the error in AWS**, try running Puppeteer with `--no-sandbox`.

```sh
PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH="$(which chromium)" node my-pdf-script.js
```

✅ **Why?**  
- Simulates **AWS Lambda’s restricted environment**.

---

## **Final Checklist**
| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| **NSS persistent database error (`-8023`)** | Add `--disable-setuid-sandbox` and `--no-sandbox` launch flags |
| **Lambda crashes (`Navigation failed because browser disconnected`)** | Increase **Lambda memory** to 2048MB+ and timeout to **120s** |
| **Old Puppeteer version incompatible** | Upgrade to latest `chrome-aws-lambda` and `puppeteer-core` |
| **Missing Chromium dependencies in AWS Lambda** | Use a **prebuilt Chrome Lambda layer** |
| **Fails in AWS but works locally** | Run with `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH="$(which chromium)"` |

---

## **Recommended Fix**
1. **Use the updated Puppeteer launch flags (Solution 1).**
2. **Increase Lambda memory to at least 2048MB (Solution 2).**
3. **Upgrade Puppeteer & chrome-aws-lambda (Solution 3).**
4. **If running in AWS Lambda, use a prebuilt Chromium Lambda layer (Solution 4).**

After applying these fixes, **your Puppeteer function should generate PDFs without NSS errors or crashes**. 🚀

The error "Error initializing NSS with a persistent database NSS error code: -8023" followed by "Navigation failed because browser has disconnected!" indicates a problem with Chromium's sandbox or profile settings within your AWS Lambda environment. This is often related to how Chromium is configured to run in the limited and ephemeral Lambda environment.

Here's a breakdown of the problem and how to resolve it:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **NSS (Network Security Services):** NSS is a set of libraries that handle security-related functions in Chromium, including certificates and encryption. The error -8023 suggests that Chromium is having trouble initializing its persistent database for NSS.
* **Lambda Environment:** AWS Lambda's execution environment is designed to be stateless and ephemeral. It has limited disk space and strict security constraints.
* **Chromium Profile/Sandbox:** Chromium typically uses a profile directory to store user data and settings. In Lambda, this can cause issues because the profile directory might not be writable or might persist across invocations, leading to conflicts.
* **Puppeteer/chrome-aws-lambda:** The combination of Puppeteer and `chrome-aws-lambda` is used to run Chromium in Lambda, but misconfigurations can lead to the NSS error.
* **Outdated versions:** The versions that the user is utilizing are very old. `chrome-aws-lambda@8.0.2 puppeteer-core@8.0.0`

**Possible Solutions**

1.  **Update `chrome-aws-lambda` and `puppeteer-core`:**
    * The versions of `chrome-aws-lambda` and `puppeteer-core` that the user is using are very old. Update these to the latest versions. The older versions might have bugs that are causing the issue.
    * Update your `package.json` with the latest versions and run `npm install`.

2.  **Disable Chromium Sandbox:**
    * In some cases, disabling the Chromium sandbox can resolve NSS initialization issues in Lambda. However, this is generally not recommended for security reasons. But in a lambda environment, it is often a necessary evil.
    * Modify your Puppeteer launch options to include the `--no-sandbox` and `--disable-setuid-sandbox` flags:

    ```javascript
    const chromium = require('chrome-aws-lambda');
    const puppeteer = chromium.puppeteer;

    exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
        let browser = null;
        try {
            browser = await puppeteer.launch({
                args: chromium.args.concat(['--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox']),
                defaultViewport: chromium.defaultViewport,
                executablePath: await chromium.executablePath,
                headless: chromium.headless,
            });
            // ... rest of your code ...
        } catch (error) {
            console.error(error);
            // ... error handling ...
        } finally {
            if (browser !== null) {
                await browser.close();
            }
        }
    };
    ```

3.  **Use a Temporary Profile Directory:**
    * Ensure Chromium is using a temporary profile directory that is writable within the Lambda environment.
    * This is normally handled correctly by the chrome-aws-lambda package, but it is good to assure that there are not any conflicting configurations.

4.  **Increase Lambda Memory and Timeout:**
    * Generating PDFs with Puppeteer can be memory-intensive. Ensure your Lambda function has sufficient memory allocated.
    * Also, increase the Lambda function's timeout to allow enough time for PDF generation, especially when dealing with large HTML content or images.

5.  **Error Handling Improvements:**
    * The provided error handling is adequate, but make sure to log the complete error object to CloudWatch Logs for more detailed debugging information.
    * Always assure that the browser is closed inside of a finally block. This is shown in the example code above.

6.  **Image Loading Issues:**
    * The problem began when image uploading was added. Check the images that are being uploaded. Large images can cause chromium to crash. Also, if the images are from untrusted sources, that can cause security issues that lead to chromium crashing.
    * Verify that the images are accessible and that the URLs are correct.

**Key Recommendations**

* **Update `chrome-aws-lambda` and `puppeteer-core` to the latest versions.** This is the most important step.
* **Add the `--no-sandbox` and `--disable-setuid-sandbox` flags.**
* **Thoroughly test your Lambda function after making changes.**
* **Monitor CloudWatch Logs for any further errors.**

By applying these steps, you should be able to resolve the NSS initialization error and successfully generate PDFs with images in your AWS Lambda function.

To resolve the **Chromium NSS error (-8023)** and browser disconnection in your AWS Lambda PDF generation function, follow these steps:

---

### **1. Configure Chromium to Use `/tmp` for NSS**
Set environment variables to redirect Chromium's certificate storage to the writable `/tmp` directory in Lambda:
```javascript
process.env.NSS_USE_SQLITE = 'yes'; // Use SQLite for certificate storage
process.env.NSS_DEFAULT_DB_TYPE = 'sql'; // Specify database type
process.env.HOME = '/tmp'; // Force Chromium to use /tmp
```

---

### **2. Update Dependencies**
Use compatible versions of `chrome-aws-lambda` and `puppeteer-core`:
```bash
npm install chrome-aws-lambda@latest puppeteer-core@latest
```
- **Recommended**: `chrome-aws-lambda@10.1.0` and `puppeteer-core@21.0.0`.

---

### **3. Adjust Chromium Launch Flags**
Modify the Puppeteer launch configuration:
```javascript
const browser = await chromium.puppeteer.launch({
  args: [
    '--no-sandbox',
    '--disable-setuid-sandbox',
    '--single-process',
    '--no-zygote',
    '--disable-dev-shm-usage',
    '--ignore-certificate-errors', // Bypass SSL errors (if images use HTTPS)
    `--user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome` // Store session data in /tmp
  ],
  executablePath: await chromium.executablePath,
  headless: chromium.headless,
  defaultViewport: null,
});
```

---

### **4. Load Images Securely**
If images are hosted externally:
1. **Use HTTPS URLs**: Ensure image URLs are valid and accessible.
2. **Bypass CORS/SSL Issues** (if necessary):
   ```javascript
   await page.setUserAgent('Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) Chrome/90.0.4430.212');
   await page.setExtraHTTPHeaders({ 'Referer': 'https://your-domain.com' });
   ```

---

### **5. Add Lambda Permissions**
Ensure your Lambda execution role has:
- **Write access** to `/tmp` (implicit in Lambda).
- **S3 PutObject** permissions for the target bucket.

---

### **6. Handle Timeouts/Memory**
- **Increase Lambda Memory**: Set to ≥ 2048 MB.
- **Extend Timeout**: Set to ≥ 1 minute (adjust based on PDF complexity).

---

### **7. Debugging Steps**
1. **Log Image URLs**: Verify URLs are reachable and not blocked.
2. **Test Locally**:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/var/task lambci/lambda:nodejs18.x
   ```
3. **Capture Screenshots**:
   ```javascript
   await page.screenshot({ path: '/tmp/debug.png' });
   ```

---

### **Final Code Example**
```javascript
const chromium = require('chrome-aws-lambda');

process.env.NSS_USE_SQLITE = 'yes';
process.env.NSS_DEFAULT_DB_TYPE = 'sql';
process.env.HOME = '/tmp';

exports.handler = async (event) => {
  let browser = null;
  try {
    browser = await chromium.puppeteer.launch({
      args: chromium.args.concat([
        '--no-sandbox',
        '--disable-setuid-sandbox',
        '--single-process',
        '--ignore-certificate-errors',
        '--user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome'
      ]),
      executablePath: await chromium.executablePath,
      headless: chromium.headless,
      defaultViewport: null,
    });

    const page = await browser.newPage();
    await page.goto('data:text/html,' + htmlContent, { waitUntil: 'networkidle2' });
    const pdf = await page.pdf({ format: 'A4' });
    
    // Upload to S3
    await s3.putObject({
      Bucket: 'your-bucket',
      Key: 'output.pdf',
      Body: pdf,
    }).promise();

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    throw error;
  } finally {
    if (browser) await browser.close();
  }
};
```

---

### **Why This Works**
- **NSS Configuration**: Redirects certificate storage to `/tmp`, resolving write permissions.
- **Chromium Flags**: Avoids sandboxing issues and SSL errors.
- **Dependency Updates**: Fixes compatibility issues in older `chrome-aws-lambda` versions.

By addressing certificate storage, SSL handling, and Lambda constraints, the NSS error and browser disconnections should resolve. Let me know if you need further help! 🚀

## ChatGPT o1

Below are the most common reasons (and remedies) for Puppeteer/Chrome failing with NSS database errors (“Error initializing NSS with a persistent database NSS error code: -8023”) in AWS Lambda. Essentially, Chromium tries to read or write the NSS (Network Security Services) data in a location that either doesn’t exist in Lambda’s read-only filesystem, or it can’t properly create a persistent profile directory. The fix is to ensure everything runs in an ephemeral, writable location (e.g., /tmp) and to launch Chromium with a few extra flags that disable or relocate the NSS database.

---

## 1. Use chrome-aws-lambda Launch Settings Properly

When using **chrome-aws-lambda** in a Lambda environment, you typically want to launch Puppeteer with the recommended flags and config. For example:

```js
const chromium = require('chrome-aws-lambda');
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer-core');

exports.handler = async (event) => {
  let browser = null;

  try {
    browser = await puppeteer.launch({
      args: [
        ...chromium.args,
        '--no-sandbox',
        '--disable-setuid-sandbox',
        '--disable-gpu',
        '--single-process',
        '--disable-dev-shm-usage',
        '--no-zygote',
        // User data dir MUST be on a writable path in Lambda, e.g., /tmp
        `--user-data-dir=${chromium.tmpDir}`,
      ],
      defaultViewport: chromium.defaultViewport,
      executablePath: await chromium.executablePath,
      headless: chromium.headless,
    });

    // Normal Puppeteer usage
    const page = await browser.newPage();
    ...
    const pdfBuffer = await page.pdf(/* options */);

    // Return or store the PDF
    return pdfBuffer.toString('base64');
  } finally {
    if (browser) {
      await browser.close();
    }
  }
};
```

Key points:

- **`--user-data-dir=${chromium.tmpDir}`** ensures that Chrome’s profile (including the NSS database) resides in the Lambda’s `/tmp` folder, which is writable at runtime.  
- **`--no-sandbox`, `--disable-dev-shm-usage`, etc.** are standard recommended flags for headless Chromium in restricted environments.  
- **Use** `chrome-aws-lambda.args`, `chrome-aws-lambda.executablePath`, etc. This ensures you’re actually using the prebuilt Chromium packaged by chrome-aws-lambda.

---

## 2. Use a Recent chrome-aws-lambda + Puppeteer Version

You mentioned using `chrome-aws-lambda@8.0.2` and `puppeteer-core@8.0.0`. Those are fairly old. Many NSS or ephemeral filesystem fixes went into later versions. It’s often best to use matching versions from the same release range – for instance:

- **chrome-aws-lambda v10+** with **puppeteer-core v10+**
- Or the newest stable version from that library

In `package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "chrome-aws-lambda": "^10.1.0",
    "puppeteer-core": "^10.1.0"
  }
}
```

(Or the newest matching minor versions.  If you must stay pinned to 8.x, at least add the correct launch flags so that Chrome’s NSS can run in ephemeral mode.)

---

## 3. Confirm You’re Not Writing Outside /tmp

On AWS Lambda, your code can only **write** to `/tmp`. Everything else is read-only. If Chromium or your upload process tries to create a file in a disallowed directory, it can trigger crashes or NSS errors. Make sure:

1. Your PDF output or any temporary files are stored in `/tmp/…` if you must.  
2. You’re not using `--user-data-dir` pointing to a directory outside `/tmp`.  
3. You have enough memory allocated to Lambda so that `/tmp` has enough space.

---

## 4. Check for Large Assets or Concurrency

If you’re uploading images, large concurrency or big images might cause short-lived spikes in memory or ephemeral storage usage. That can cause the browser to crash or become unresponsive, sometimes manifesting as an NSS or navigation error. Solutions include:

- **Increasing** the Lambda’s memory setting (which also gives you a bigger `/tmp`).  
- **Serializing** or batching your requests so you’re not launching too many Puppeteer instances at once.  
- **Ensuring** you properly close the browser/page to free up resources.

---

## 5. Avoid “Persistent” Profile Usage if You Only Need Headless

Finally, remember that ephemeral headless usage in AWS Lambda typically doesn’t need a persistent user profile. So once you specify `--user-data-dir=/tmp/...` and the standard “headless” flags, there’s no need for further NSS or DB. That alone usually bypasses the `Error initializing NSS with a persistent database` issue.

---

### Summary

- Upgrade or align your `chrome-aws-lambda` and `puppeteer-core` versions if possible.  
- Always pass the recommended flags, especially `--user-data-dir=${chromium.tmpDir}`, so NSS stores data in `/tmp`.  
- Keep concurrency, memory, and ephemeral file usage in check.  

This approach prevents Chrome from attempting to create a persistent NSS database in a read-only location, resolving the “NSS error code: -8023” in AWS Lambda.

Below is an evaluation of each chatbot response, measured against the **baseline answer** from Stack Overflow.

---

## Baseline Answer (Summary)

The user’s Puppeteer-based PDF lambda function, using `chrome-aws-lambda` and `puppeteer-core`, is crashing with an **NSS error** (`-8023`) in AWS. The **baseline fix** is:

> AWS updated the Node version for Lambdas. You can fix the error by upgrading your environment or manually pinning the older Node runtime. For example, using Node 18.18.0. That resolves the “Error initializing NSS with a persistent database” issue.

So the baseline specifically says it was caused by an update to the Node runtime in Lambdas, and that using a certain pinned Node version resolved it.  

---

## Chatbot Response #1

### Accuracy
- #1 suggests the error is caused by NSS failing to initialize in a read-only environment or missing dependencies, and it suggests:
  - Using special Chrome flags (`--no-sandbox`, etc.)
  - Possibly upgrading Puppeteer and `chrome-aws-lambda`
  - Possibly using a Lambda layer with dependencies
- The baseline states the cause is “AWS silently updated Node version for Lambdas” and that using a pinned Node version (like 18.18) worked. #1 does not mention that. It suggests general typical Chrome/Puppeteer in Lambda solutions, not the specific solution from the baseline (pin Node version).

# Summary

**All** chatbot responses revolve around typical “Chrome + NSS + ephemeral environment” solutions for Puppeteer in Lambda. The **baseline** specifically says the real fix is to use Node v18.18 or prevent AWS from automatically upgrading the runtime. None of the responses mention that. They all skip that direct solution.

**Response #3** is incomplete. The others are partially correct but do not reflect the baseline’s specific fix.

**Overall Best**: Possibly #1 is thorough about general solutions, but none mention the Node version fix from the baseline. So #1 or #4 or #5 might be considered best among them. 
**Overall Worst**: #3 is incomplete.
