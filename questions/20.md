How to use aws-sdk in an AWS lambda

How do I use aws-sdk in a lambda. I'm trying to follow this https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/lambda-send-email-ses/ but I cannot get `var aws = require("aws-sdk");` to work, I get an error "require is not defined in ES module scope, you can use import instead" How come AWS’s own solution doesn't even work?

EDIT: using `import { AWS } from 'aws-sdk';` doesn't work either, I get the error "Cannot find package 'aws-sdk' imported from /var/task/index.mjs"

## Highest-scored answer 

I solved the issue. I used `import { SESClient, SendEmailCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ses";` instead

When using the `aws-sdk` in an AWS Lambda function, it's essential to ensure that the SDK is correctly imported and that your Lambda environment is correctly configured to recognize the module. The error you are encountering is likely due to the use of ES modules (`.mjs`) instead of CommonJS modules (`.js`). Here’s how you can resolve this issue:

### Solution 1: Use CommonJS (Recommended for AWS Lambda)

#### 1. Use `.js` File Extension
Ensure your Lambda function file has a `.js` extension (CommonJS module).

#### 2. Import `aws-sdk` Using `require`
Use the CommonJS `require` syntax to import the `aws-sdk` module.

```javascript
// index.js
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');

const ses = new AWS.SES({ region: 'us-east-1' });

exports.handler = async (event) => {
  const params = {
    Destination: {
      ToAddresses: ['recipient@example.com'],
    },
    Message: {
      Body: {
        Text: { Data: 'Hello, this is a test email from SES' },
      },
      Subject: { Data: 'Test Email' },
    },
    Source: 'sender@example.com',
  };

  try {
    const result = await ses.sendEmail(params).promise();
    console.log(result);
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Email sent successfully' }),
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    return {
      statusCode: 500,
      body: JSON.stringify({ error: 'Failed to send email' }),
    };
  }
};
```

### Solution 2: Use ES Modules (if you must use `.mjs`)

If you need to use ES modules, ensure the `package.json` is correctly set up, and you are using the correct import syntax.

#### 1. Update `package.json`
Ensure your `package.json` specifies `"type": "module"`.

```json
{
  "type": "module"
}
```

#### 2. Import `aws-sdk` Using `import`
Use the ES module `import` syntax to import the `aws-sdk`.

```javascript
// index.mjs
import AWS from 'aws-sdk';

const ses = new AWS.SES({ region: 'us-east-1' });

export const handler = async (event) => {
  const params = {
    Destination: {
      ToAddresses: ['recipient@example.com'],
    },
    Message: {
      Body: {
        Text: { Data: 'Hello, this is a test email from SES' },
      },
      Subject: { Data: 'Test Email' },
    },
    Source: 'sender@example.com',
  };

  try {
    const result = await ses.sendEmail(params).promise();
    console.log(result);
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Email sent successfully' }),
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    return {
      statusCode: 500,
      body: JSON.stringify({ error: 'Failed to send email' }),
    };
  }
};
```

### Packaging the Lambda Function
Ensure the `aws-sdk` is available in the Lambda deployment package. When deploying through the AWS Management Console, AWS automatically provides the `aws-sdk`. If you are deploying manually or using a deployment tool, ensure `aws-sdk` is included in your `node_modules`.

### Deploying the Lambda Function
1. **Using the AWS Management Console**:
   - Zip your project directory, ensuring `node_modules` is included.
   - Upload the zip file in the Lambda function code section.

2. **Using AWS CLI or SAM**:
   - Use the AWS CLI or AWS SAM to deploy your Lambda function.

### Example Deployment with AWS CLI

```sh
zip -r function.zip index.js node_modules
aws lambda update-function-code --function-name YourLambdaFunctionName --zip-file fileb://function.zip
```

### Example Deployment with AWS SAM

```yaml
# template.yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Resources:
  MyLambdaFunction:
    Type: 'AWS::Lambda::Function'
    Properties:
      Handler: index.handler
      Runtime: nodejs14.x
      CodeUri: .
      MemorySize: 128
      Timeout: 30
      Policies:
        - AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole
```

```sh
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```

By following these steps, you should be able to use the `aws-sdk` in your Lambda function without encountering the import errors.


## ChatGPT-4

The issues you are encountering while trying to use the `aws-sdk` in an AWS Lambda function are likely related to the JavaScript runtime environment configuration, specifically how ES modules and CommonJS modules are handled. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how to resolve this:

### Understanding the Error
1. **"require is not defined in ES module scope"** – This error suggests that your Lambda function is configured to use ES modules, which do not support `require()`, instead using the `import` syntax.
2. **"Cannot find package 'aws-sdk' imported"** – This indicates that when using ES modules (`import` syntax), the Node.js runtime cannot locate the `aws-sdk` package. This could be due to how the package is referenced or the setup of your deployment package.

### Solutions to Consider

#### Adjusting Lambda for CommonJS
If you prefer to use `require()` (CommonJS), ensure your Lambda is configured to use CommonJS. This might involve:

- **Changing the file extension**: Use `.js` instead of `.mjs` for your Lambda function's script.
- **Adjusting `package.json`**: If your project includes a `package.json`, make sure it doesn't enforce `"type": "module"`, which would cause Node.js to treat `.js` files as ES modules.

Here’s a basic setup:
```javascript
// index.js
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const ses = new AWS.SES({ apiVersion: '2010-12-01' });

exports.handler = async (event) => {
  const params = {
    Source: "sender@example.com",
    Destination: {
      ToAddresses: ["recipient@example.com"],
    },
    Message: {
      Subject: {
        Data: "Test Email",
      },
      Body: {
        Text: {
          Data: "Hello from AWS SES (via Lambda)!",
        },
      },
    },
  };

  try {
    const data = await ses.sendEmail(params).promise();
    console.log("Email sent:", data);
    return data;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Failed to send email:", err);
    throw err;
  }
};
```

#### Configuring Lambda for ES Modules
If you want to continue using ES modules:
- **Ensure your `package.json` specifies** `"type": "module"`.
- **Use the `import` statement** correctly:

```javascript
// index.mjs
import AWS from 'aws-sdk';
const ses = new AWS.SES({ apiVersion: '2010-12-01' });

export async function handler(event) {
  const params = {
    Source: "sender@example.com",
    Destination: {
      ToAddresses: ["recipient@example.com"],
    },
    Message: {
      Subject: {
        Data: "Test Email",
      },
      Body: {
        Text: {
          Data: "Hello from AWS SES (via Lambda)!",
        },
      },
    },
  };

  try {
    const data = await ses.sendEmail(params).promise();
    console.log("Email sent:", data);
    return data;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Failed to send email:", err);
    throw err;
  }
}
```
- **Ensure AWS SDK is included in your deployment**: If you’re deploying via the AWS Management Console, ensure the `node_modules` directory containing `aws-sdk` is included in the ZIP file uploaded. AWS SDK is available by default in the Lambda runtime, but if you’re using a custom build process or a newer version, it might not be recognized without being explicitly included.

### Deploying Your Lambda
When deploying, if you're using external modules:
- **Package your Lambda function**: Include `node_modules` if you have additional dependencies or need a specific version of `aws-sdk`. This can be done by running `npm install` in your project directory to create a `node_modules` folder, then zipping this along with your function code.
- **Use AWS CLI or SAM for deployment**: These tools can help automate the process and ensure all necessary files are included.

### Final Checks
- **Test locally**: You can use tools like `AWS SAM CLI` or `lambda-local` to test your function on your machine before deployment.
- **Check Lambda logs**: After deployment, check the execution logs in Amazon CloudWatch to ensure there are no runtime errors.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully configure and use `aws-sdk` in your AWS Lambda function using either CommonJS or ES Module formats.


## Gemini

The user is encountering an issue using aws-sdk in an AWS Lambda due to changes in Node.js runtime environment. Here's how to address it:
Understanding the Issue:
The provided AWS documentation snippet uses require, which is a CommonJS syntax for importing modules.
Modern AWS Lambda runtimes (Node.js 14.x and above) use the ECMAScript module (ESM) syntax, which requires import statements.
Resolving the Issue:
1. Update Import Statement:
Replace var aws = require("aws-sdk"); with the following ESM syntax:
JavaScript
import { SES } from 'aws-sdk';


This imports the SES service from the aws-sdk library. You can replace SES with any other AWS service you need.
2. Install aws-sdk:
Ensure you have the aws-sdk library installed in your Lambda function's dependencies. You can do this using npm install aws-sdk or yarn add aws-sdk in your project directory.
3. Update Build Configuration (if applicable):
If you're using a bundler like Webpack, ensure it's configured to handle ESM syntax. Refer to your bundler's documentation for specific configuration details.
Addressing the Edit:
The error "Cannot find package 'aws-sdk' imported from /var/task/index.mjs" indicates that the aws-sdk package is not installed in your Lambda function. Make sure you've included it in your project's dependencies and deployed the updated code to your Lambda function.
Additional Tips:
Consider using environment variables to store your AWS credentials instead of including them directly in your code for improved security.
Refer to the official AWS documentation for Node.js version compatibility with specific AWS SDK versions: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html
By following these steps, the AWS user should be able to successfully use aws-sdk in their Lambda function using the correct ESM import syntax.
