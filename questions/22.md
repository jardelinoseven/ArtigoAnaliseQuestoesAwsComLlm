## [Question 22](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75249033/aws-allow-user-to-create-policies-that-doesnt-create-other-policies)

AWS allow user to create policies that doesn't create other policies?

Is it possible to allow a user to create policies that doesn't contain any IAM Write actions, such as `iam:CreatePolicy` or `iam:AttachPolicyRole`?

The reason I'm asking is that the company I work at has a single person which can create policies & roles for security reasons. But this is quickly becoming a bottleneck, and we would like to transfer the responsibility of creating roles & policies to more people in a secure fashion. One way I can think is to limit the actions a policy can have, and the most sensitive actions are IAM actions, but I don't know if this is possible.

## Highest-scored answer 

IAM has an important feature called [permissions boundaries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html):

>A permissions boundary is an advanced feature for using a managed policy to set the maximum permissions that an identity-based policy can grant to an IAM entity. An entity's permissions boundary allows it to perform only the actions that are allowed by both its identity-based policies and its permissions boundaries.

A permissions boundary is designed to restrict permissions on IAM principals (IAM users and IAM roles). It enforces a centrally-managed boundary that can’t be exceeded, even if broader permissions are granted by some other policy attached to the IAM principal.

Permissions boundaries can also be used to restrict what permissions that IAM principal can grant when creating new IAM principals.

Here's an example of an IAM statement that you could add to an IAM user's policies that would allow that user to create new IAM users and roles but restrict the created roles and users to a specified permissions boundary:

```
"Statement": [
  {
    "Sid": "AllowIAMCreate",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [ "iam:CreateUser", "iam:CreateRole" ],
    "Resource": "*"
  },
  {
    "Sid": "DenyIAMCreateWithoutBoundary",
    "Effect": "Deny",
    "Action": [ "iam:CreateUser", "iam:CreateRole" ],
    "Resource": [
      "arn:aws:iam::1234567890:user/*",
      "arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/*"
    ],
    "Condition": {
      "StringNotEquals": {
        "iam":PermissionsBoundary": "arn:aws:iam::1234567890:policy/DevBoundary"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

## ChatGPT 4o

To allow a user to create IAM policies but restrict them from including any IAM write actions (like `iam:CreatePolicy`, `iam:AttachRolePolicy`, etc.), you can use IAM policy conditions to restrict the actions that can be included in the policies they create. This can be achieved using the `iam:PermissionsBoundary` condition.

Here's a step-by-step approach to set this up:

### Step 1: Create a Permissions Boundary Policy

Create a permissions boundary policy that explicitly denies the IAM write actions you want to restrict. This policy will be used as a permissions boundary for the policies created by the users.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": [
        "iam:CreatePolicy",
        "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
        "iam:PutRolePolicy",
        "iam:PutUserPolicy",
        "iam:AttachUserPolicy",
        "iam:AttachGroupPolicy"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Attach the Permissions Boundary to Users

Ensure that the permissions boundary is applied to the users who will be creating policies. This can be done via the AWS Management Console or using the AWS CLI.

Using the AWS CLI:

```sh
aws iam put-user-permissions-boundary --user-name <user-name> --permissions-boundary arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:policy/<permissions-boundary-policy-name>
```

### Step 3: Create IAM Policy to Allow Policy Creation

Create an IAM policy that grants the necessary permissions for creating policies but requires the permissions boundary.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iam:CreatePolicy",
        "iam:CreatePolicyVersion",
        "iam:DeletePolicy",
        "iam:DeletePolicyVersion",
        "iam:GetPolicy",
        "iam:GetPolicyVersion",
        "iam:ListPolicyVersions",
        "iam:SetDefaultPolicyVersion"
      ],
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "iam:PermissionsBoundary": "arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:policy/<permissions-boundary-policy-name>"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 4: Attach the Policy to the Users

Attach this policy to the users or groups who need to create policies.

Using the AWS CLI:

```sh
aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name <user-name> --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:policy/<policy-name>
```

### Step 5: Verify the Setup

1. **Create a test policy** using an account that has the newly attached policy and verify that it can create policies.
2. **Try to create a policy** that includes restricted IAM actions and ensure it fails.

### Example Policy for Test User:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Additional Considerations:

- **Policy Governance**: Regularly audit the policies created by users to ensure they comply with organizational policies.
- **Training and Documentation**: Provide training and documentation to users who will be creating policies to ensure they understand the limitations and best practices.

By following these steps, you can delegate the responsibility of creating IAM policies to more users while ensuring that sensitive IAM write actions are restricted.


## ChatGPT-4

Creating IAM policies that restrict users to only certain actions while explicitly denying others, especially for sensitive operations like managing IAM policies themselves, is a fundamental aspect of least privilege in AWS security. To achieve what you're describing—allowing users to create policies that do not include IAM write actions—you can leverage AWS IAM's permission boundaries.

### Using Permission Boundaries

Permission boundaries are advanced features in AWS IAM that allow you to set a maximum permissions boundary that a user's IAM policies can grant. This can be used to delegate permissions management to other users safely, ensuring they cannot grant more permissions than the boundary allows.

Here’s how you can implement this:

1. **Create a Permission Boundary Policy**:
   - Define a policy that excludes IAM management actions. This policy will act as a boundary for any user or role it's attached to, preventing them from including IAM write permissions in any policies they create.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {"StringNotLike": {"iam:PermissionsBoundary": "arn:aws:iam::*:policy/YourPermissionBoundaryPolicy"}}
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": [
                "iam:CreatePolicy",
                "iam:DeletePolicy",
                "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
                "iam:DetachRolePolicy",
                "iam:PutRolePolicy"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

2. **Attach the Permission Boundary to User Roles**:
   - Apply this permission boundary to any IAM role or user who will be creating policies. This boundary ensures they cannot create or attach policies that grant IAM management capabilities.

```bash
aws iam put-role-permission-boundary --role-name YourRoleName --permissions-boundary arn:aws:iam::your-account-id:policy/YourPermissionBoundaryPolicy
```

3. **Delegate Policy Creation**:
   - Users with this boundary can still create and manage other policies within the limits set by the permission boundary. This setup ensures they cannot escalate privileges.

### Additional Considerations

- **Auditing and Monitoring**: Use AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config to monitor and log all IAM actions. This helps in auditing changes and ensuring compliance with your organization's security policies.
- **Regular Reviews**: Regularly review and update the permission boundaries and associated policies to adapt to new requirements or changes in the organization.
- **Training and Guidelines**: Provide training for users who are allowed to create policies to ensure they understand the boundaries and the organization’s best practices.

### Conclusion

Permission boundaries provide a robust mechanism for safely delegating permissions management in AWS, allowing you to expand the number of users who can create policies without compromising on security. By carefully designing these boundaries, you can prevent privilege escalation while reducing bottlenecks in managing IAM resources.

While directly preventing users from creating policies containing IAM write actions isn't possible, AWS IAM offers several strategies to achieve a more granular and secure approach to delegating IAM policy and role creation:
1. IAM Permissions Boundaries:
Define a permissions boundary policy that restricts the maximum permissions any identity-based policy (user or role) can grant. This policy can explicitly deny IAM write actions like iam:CreatePolicy and iam:AttachPolicyRole.
Create user policies or role policies for authorized users that allow them to create policies but only with specific permissions and disallow IAM write actions.
2. Service Catalog Portfolios:
Create a Service Catalog portfolio with pre-defined templates for roles and policies with limited permissions. Users with appropriate permissions in Service Catalog can then create roles and policies from these approved templates.
This approach ensures consistency and reduces the risk of creating overly broad or insecure policies.
3. AssumeRole with MFA:
Implement a central role with permissions to create IAM policies and roles. Users requiring these permissions can assume this role with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for added security.
This centralizes policy creation while requiring a second factor for authorization.
4. AWS Organizations (if applicable):
If you're using AWS Organizations, consider creating Organizational Units (OUs) and attaching policies at the OU level. This allows you to grant users permission to create roles and policies within their assigned OUs, providing a layer of segregation.
Combining Strategies:
For enhanced security, consider combining these strategies. For example, use permissions boundaries along with Service Catalog templates or assume role with MFA.
Additional Considerations:
Implement a robust least privilege policy principle. Users should only have the minimum permissions required to perform their tasks.
Regularly review user permissions and access logs to identify potential risks.
Educate users on secure IAM practices and the importance of following security best practices.
By implementing these strategies, the AWS user can delegate IAM policy and role creation responsibilities while maintaining a secure environment. Choose the approach that best aligns with your specific needs and security requirements.
