Amplify Gen 2: Put data in DynamoDB using Lambda

I am having trouble getting Lambda to insert data into the Todo table defined in Amplify.

Specifically, how do I obtain 'DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME' and 'AWS_REGION'? I am encountering the error "Property 'DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME' does not exist on type 'LambdaProvidedEnvVars & AmplifyBackendEnvVars'" in the 'env' object.

I have seen examples with S3, where Amplify automatically creates an environment variable for the created bucket, but I am unable to resolve this for DynamoDB.

According to the [documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/vue/build-a-backend/functions/grant-access-to-other-resources/), I have two options to grant Lambda access to other resources: the access property and CDK. However, it seems that my skills to resolve this are insufficient.

I hope to be able to add data from Lambda to the Todo table defined in amplify/data/resource.ts.

I have this code:
```
// amplify/data/resource.ts
import { type ClientSchema, a, defineData } from "@aws-amplify/backend";
import { generateStory } from "../functions/generate-story/resource";

const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a
    .model({
      content: a.string(),
    })
    .authorization((allow) => [allow.guest()]),
});

export type Schema = ClientSchema<typeof schema>;

export const data = defineData({
  schema,
});
```

And this:
```
// amplify/functions/generate-story/handler.ts
import { DynamoDBClient, PutItemCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb";
import { env } from "$amplify/env/generate-story";

const ddbClient = new DynamoDBClient({ region: env.AWS_REGION });

export const handler = async (event) => {
  const command = new PutItemCommand({
    TableName: env.DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME,
    Item: {
      id: { S: 'example-id' },
      content: { S: 'example-content' }
    },
  });

  try {
    await ddbClient.send(command);
    
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Item inserted successfully" }),
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error inserting item:", error);
    return {
      statusCode: 500,
      body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Error inserting item" }),
    };
  }
};
```

## Baseline answer 

Looking at your code I presume you're using Amplify Gen 2 backend?

They've moved from the Gen 1 way of doing this (where amplify generates the table variables etc.). The Lambda should use the schema with generateClient from aws-amplify/data to access the dynamodb tables. This is far better than messing around with env variables everywhere IMO. The schema has to allow the lambda function to do this - permissions defined in the (amplify/data/resource.ts). 

Follow the guide here:

https://docs.amplify.aws/react-native/build-a-backend/functions/examples/create-user-profile-record/

You need the latest version of everything amplify. To support importing env from "$amplify/env/post-confirmation" I had to add the path to the amplify/tsconfig.json:

    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "es2022",
        "module": "es2022",
        "moduleResolution": "bundler",
        "resolveJsonModule": true,
        "esModuleInterop": true,
        "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
        "strict": true,
        "skipLibCheck": true,
        "paths": {
          "$amplify/*": ["../.amplify/generated/*"]
        }
      },
    }

### **Fixing Amplify Gen 2: Insert Data into DynamoDB Using Lambda**
You're facing an issue where **`DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME` and `AWS_REGION`** are not being automatically set in your Lambda function’s environment variables. This happens because **Amplify does not automatically create environment variables for DynamoDB tables like it does for S3 buckets**.

---

## **Solution 1: Manually Define Environment Variables**
Since **Amplify does not auto-generate environment variables for DynamoDB**, you need to **manually specify them** in the function’s configuration.

### **Step 1: Retrieve Your DynamoDB Table Name**
Amplify **auto-generates table names** based on the project, environment, and data schema. To get the exact table name, check:
```sh
amplify status
```
Look under the **"Data"** category, and note the **table name** (e.g., `amplify_projectName_env_Todo`).

Alternatively, find the name in **AWS DynamoDB Console** under **Tables**.

---

### **Step 2: Add Environment Variables in `resource.ts`**
Modify your **Lambda function definition** to manually pass the DynamoDB table name.

Edit `amplify/functions/generate-story/resource.ts`:
```ts
import { defineFunction } from "@aws-amplify/backend";

export const generateStory = defineFunction({
  name: "generateStory",
  environment: {
    DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME: "amplify_projectName_env_Todo",
    AWS_REGION: "us-east-1", // Change to your actual region
  },
});
```

✅ **Why?**  
- This **explicitly defines** the environment variables Amplify needs.
- The **table name must match** the one generated by Amplify.

---

## **Solution 2: Use Amplify’s `access` Property to Grant Lambda Permissions**
Amplify requires **explicit permissions** for Lambda to access the DynamoDB table.

Modify your **function definition** in `amplify/functions/generate-story/resource.ts`:
```ts
import { defineFunction } from "@aws-amplify/backend";
import { data } from "../../data/resource";

export const generateStory = defineFunction({
  name: "generateStory",
  access: [data.Todo], // Grant access to the Todo table
  environment: {
    DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME: data.Todo.tableName, // Reference the table dynamically
    AWS_REGION: "us-east-1",
  },
});
```

✅ **Why?**  
- The **`access: [data.Todo]`** grants the function **read/write permissions**.
- **`data.Todo.tableName`** dynamically retrieves the correct **DynamoDB table name**.

---

## **Solution 3: Verify Lambda IAM Permissions for DynamoDB**
If the function is still **failing to write to DynamoDB**, check if the **IAM role assigned to Lambda has permissions**.

### **Step 1: Get the Lambda Role Name**
Run:
```sh
aws lambda get-function --function-name generate-story --query "Configuration.Role"
```
Copy the **IAM role ARN**.

### **Step 2: Attach DynamoDB Permissions**
Run:
```sh
aws iam attach-role-policy \
    --role-name <LAMBDA_ROLE_NAME> \
    --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess
```

Or, add this policy manually in the **AWS IAM Console**:
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "dynamodb:PutItem",
    "dynamodb:GetItem",
    "dynamodb:UpdateItem",
    "dynamodb:DeleteItem",
    "dynamodb:Scan",
    "dynamodb:Query"
  ],
  "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:123456789012:table/amplify_projectName_env_Todo"
}
```

✅ **Why?**  
- Lambda **needs explicit permissions** to write to DynamoDB.

---

## **Solution 4: Deploy and Verify**
After making changes, redeploy your Amplify backend:
```sh
amplify push
```
Then **test your Lambda function** using:
```sh
amplify function invoke generate-story
```

✅ **Expected Output**
```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "body": "{\"message\": \"Item inserted successfully\"}"
}
```

---

## **Final Checklist**
| **Issue** | **Solution** |
|-----------|-------------|
| **`DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME` not found** | Define it explicitly in `resource.ts` |
| **Lambda does not have DynamoDB permissions** | Use `access: [data.Todo]` in function config |
| **IAM role lacks DynamoDB write access** | Attach `AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess` to Lambda IAM role |
| **Deployment issues** | Run `amplify push` and test with `amplify function invoke` |

---

## **Final Recommendation**
1. **Modify `amplify/functions/generate-story/resource.ts`** to explicitly set the **table name** and **grant access**.
2. **Ensure Lambda has IAM permissions** to write to DynamoDB.
3. **Deploy using `amplify push`** and test.

After these changes, **your Lambda should successfully insert items into DynamoDB**! 🚀 Let me know if you need further debugging. 🎯


## Gemini

The core issue is that the user is trying to access `DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME` and `AWS_REGION` directly from the `env` object in their Lambda function, but these environment variables are not automatically exposed in the way they expect for DynamoDB tables. This is different from how S3 buckets are handled.

Here's a breakdown of the problem and the solutions:

**Understanding the Problem:**

* **Amplify Gen 2 Environment Variables:**
    * Amplify Gen 2 handles environment variables differently. While it does provide some automatically, it doesn't expose DynamoDB table names directly through the `env` object in the same way as S3 bucket names.
    * The error "Property 'DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME' does not exist on type 'LambdaProvidedEnvVars & AmplifyBackendEnvVars'" confirms this.
* **Accessing DynamoDB Resources:**
    * To interact with DynamoDB tables defined in Amplify Data, you need to use the AWS SDK and obtain the necessary resource information.
    * The documentation provided by the user is correct, that the options are access property and CDK.

**Solutions:**

1.  **Using CDK (Recommended):**

    * CDK provides the most flexible and robust way to access and configure resources in Amplify.
    * **Modify `amplify/backend.ts`:**
        * You can use CDK to retrieve the DynamoDB table name and inject it as an environment variable into your Lambda function.
        * Example:
            ```typescript
            // amplify/backend.ts
            import { defineBackend } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
            import { data } from './data/resource';
            import { generateStory } from './functions/generate-story/resource';
            import { Stack } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
            import { Table } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-dynamodb';
            import { Function } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda';

            const backend = defineBackend({
              data,
              generateStory,
            });

            backend.generateStory.resources.lambda.forEach((lambdaFunction: Function) => {
              const table = Table.fromTableName(
                Stack.of(lambdaFunction),
                'TodoTable',
                backend.data.resources.tables.Todo.tableName
              );
              lambdaFunction.addEnvironment('DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME', table.tableName);
              lambdaFunction.addEnvironment('AWS_REGION', Stack.of(lambdaFunction).region);
              table.grantReadWriteData(lambdaFunction);
            });
            ```
        * **Explanation:**
            * This code retrieves the `Todo` table from the `data.resources.tables` object.
            * It then adds the table name and AWS region as environment variables to the `generateStory` Lambda function.
            * It also grants the lambda function the correct permissions to read and write to the dynamodb table.
    * **Update `handler.ts`:**
        * Now, you can access `DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME` and `AWS_REGION` from the `env` object.
            ```typescript
            // amplify/functions/generate-story/handler.ts
            import { DynamoDBClient, PutItemCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb";

            const ddbClient = new DynamoDBClient({ region: process.env.AWS_REGION });

            export const handler = async (event) => {
              const command = new PutItemCommand({
                TableName: process.env.DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME,
                Item: {
                  id: { S: 'example-id' },
                  content: { S: 'example-content' },
                },
              });

              try {
                await ddbClient.send(command);

                return {
                  statusCode: 200,
                  body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Item inserted successfully" }),
                };
              } catch (error) {
                console.error("Error inserting item:", error);
                return {
                  statusCode: 500,
                  body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Error inserting item" }),
                };
              }
            };

            ```
2.  **Using IAM Permissions (Less Recommended for this case):**

    * While you *could* use IAM permissions to grant the Lambda function access to all DynamoDB tables, this is generally not the best practice.
    * It's better to grant specific permissions to the table you need.
    * Since the CDK method is cleaner, and grants the correct permissions, it is the better option.

**Key Improvements:**

* **Explicit Resource Access:** The CDK approach provides explicit control over resource access and configuration.
* **Environment Variable Injection:** It correctly injects the necessary environment variables into the Lambda function.
* **Permissions Management:** It automatically grants the Lambda function the required permissions to interact with the DynamoDB table.

By using the CDK approach, the user can effectively access the DynamoDB table name and region, resolving the environment variable issue and enabling their Lambda function to insert data into the table.

To resolve the **missing environment variables** (`DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME` and `AWS_REGION`) when accessing DynamoDB from your Amplify Gen 2 Lambda function, follow these steps:

---

### **1. Grant Lambda Access to the DynamoDB Table**
In your `generate-story` function's resource file (`amplify/functions/generate-story/resource.ts`), explicitly grant access to the `data` resource:

```typescript
// amplify/functions/generate-story/resource.ts
import { defineFunction } from "@aws-amplify/backend";
import { data } from "../../data/resource";

export const generateStory = defineFunction({
  name: "generate-story",
  access: [data], // Grants access to all models in `data`
  // OR granular access: access: [data.resources.Todo]
});
```

This automatically injects the `DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME` and `AWS_REGION` into your Lambda's environment variables.

---

### **2. Use Correct Environment Variable Names**
Amplify Gen 2 injects environment variables with this format:
- `DATA_{RESOURCE_NAME}_{MODEL_NAME}_TABLE_NAME`
- `AWS_REGION` (auto-populated by AWS)

In your handler, reference them like this:
```typescript
// amplify/functions/generate-story/handler.ts
const tableName = env.DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME; // Format: DATA_<resource>_<model>_TABLE_NAME
const region = env.AWS_REGION; // Already provided by Amplify
```

---

### **3. Verify Amplify Deployment**
After updating the code:
1. Run `npx amplify sandbox` to test locally.
2. Deploy with `npx amplify deploy`.

---

### **4. Check Environment Variables (Post-Deploy)**
In the **AWS Lambda Console**:
1. Navigate to your deployed function.
2. Under **Configuration → Environment variables**, confirm `DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME` and `AWS_REGION` exist.

---

### **Key Fixes**
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Missing permissions | Add `access: [data]` to the function’s resource config |
| Incorrect variable names | Use Amplify’s auto-generated `DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME` |
| Region not set | `AWS_REGION` is auto-injected by Amplify |

---

### **Final Code Example**
```typescript
// amplify/functions/generate-story/resource.ts
import { defineFunction } from "@aws-amplify/backend";
import { data } from "../../data/resource";

export const generateStory = defineFunction({
  name: "generate-story",
  access: [data], // Grants access to DynamoDB
});
```

```typescript
// amplify/functions/generate-story/handler.ts
import { DynamoDBClient, PutItemCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb";
import { env } from "$amplify/env/generate-story";

const ddbClient = new DynamoDBClient({ region: env.AWS_REGION });

export const handler = async () => {
  await ddbClient.send(
    new PutItemCommand({
      TableName: env.DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME,
      Item: { id: { S: "1" }, content: { S: "Test" } },
    })
  );
  return { statusCode: 200 };
};
```

By granting explicit access and using Amplify’s auto-injected variables, the Lambda function will now interact with DynamoDB successfully. Let me know if you need further help! 🚀

## ChatGPT o1

Below is the general approach in Amplify “Gen 2” projects for letting a Lambda function write to a Data Store (DynamoDB) table and retrieving the table name in your function’s code. In Gen 2, Amplify does not automatically create a `DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME` variable unless you explicitly define it in your function’s configuration and grant access to the table.

---

## 1. Define the Data Resource (Your Todo Model)

You already have:

```ts
// amplify/data/resource.ts
import { type ClientSchema, a, defineData } from "@aws-amplify/backend";
import { generateStory } from "../functions/generate-story/resource";

const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a
    .model({
      content: a.string(),
    })
    .authorization((allow) => [allow.guest()]),
});

export type Schema = ClientSchema<typeof schema>;

export const data = defineData({
  schema,
});
```

Here, `data.models.Todo` is your DynamoDB model resource. Amplify will create the table, but it won’t automatically inject a table-name environment variable unless you configure it.

---

## 2. Define Your Lambda Function Resource With Access and Environment Vars

In Gen 2 Amplify, you typically define each function in a `resource.ts` file in `amplify/functions/<functionName>/resource.ts`. For instance:

```ts
// amplify/functions/generate-story/resource.ts
import { defineFunction } from "@aws-amplify/backend";
import { data } from "../../data/resource";

export const generateStory = defineFunction(
  {
    name: "generate-story",

    // Give this function permission to put items in the Todo model's table
    // `access` is the new Gen 2 approach to referencing resources
    access: [
      data.models.Todo, // this ensures "PutItem" is allowed on the underlying DynamoDB table
    ],

    // Create an environment variable that references the actual table name
    environmentVariables: {
      DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME: data.models.Todo.tableName,
    },

    // If you want to allow other ops or configure memory/timeouts, do so here
    // ...
  },
  // optional second argument:  a function handle or code bundler config
  (event) => {
    // (This is optional if your actual code is in handler.ts)
  }
);
```

Important bits:

- `access: [data.models.Todo]` tells Amplify:  
  1. Grant `PutItem` (and other standard CRUD) permissions in IAM for that underlying DynamoDB table.  
  2. Expose `data.models.Todo.tableName` as a property you can reference for environment variables, if you like.

- `environmentVariables: { DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME: data.models.Todo.tableName }` instructs Amplify to actually define `DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME` in your Lambda’s environment, pointing to the real table name that it auto-generates. This is crucial – otherwise your function’s environment won’t include that variable.

After you define this, run `amplify push` (or whichever command you use) so Amplify can update your backend stack. Amplify will create the necessary IAM policies and set up the environment variable.

---

## 3. Import the Generated Env in Your Handler Code

Amplify Gen 2 automatically creates typed environment variables for you in `amplify/functions/generate-story/dist/env.d.ts` (or a similar “env” helper). You can typically import them like so:

```ts
// amplify/functions/generate-story/handler.ts
import { DynamoDBClient, PutItemCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb";

// The env import below is auto-generated by Amplify
import { env } from "$amplify/env/generate-story";

// The rest of your code...
const ddbClient = new DynamoDBClient({ region: env.AWS_REGION });

export const handler = async (event) => {
  const command = new PutItemCommand({
    TableName: env.DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME,
    Item: {
      id: { S: "example-id" },
      content: { S: "example-content" },
    },
  });

  try {
    await ddbClient.send(command);

    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Item inserted successfully" }),
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error inserting item:", error);
    return {
      statusCode: 500,
      body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Error inserting item" }),
    };
  }
};
```

Because you defined `environmentVariables: { DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME: data.models.Todo.tableName }` in your function resource, `env.DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME` will now exist. The typed definition is generated by Amplify at build time, so TypeScript can reference it safely.

---

## 4. Deploy / Push

Finally, run:

```bash
amplify push
```

This instructs Amplify to:

1. Create or update the Todo model’s DynamoDB table.  
2. Attach the correct IAM policy to the “generate-story” Lambda, granting `PutItem` on the table.  
3. Inject the `DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME` environment variable into the Lambda.  
4. Generate the local “env” type definitions so you can import them in your code.

After that, you can call your `generate-story` function and see that it successfully puts items into the Todo table.

---

### Key Takeaways

- **Explicitly define environment vars** in your function’s resource config:  
  `environmentVariables: { DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME: data.models.Todo.tableName }`
- **Use the `access` array** to grant your function the correct permissions to the Data resource.  
- **Import** from `$amplify/env/<functionName>` to read those environment vars at runtime.  

That’s the standard pattern for letting a Gen 2 Amplify function read or write to a table created by `defineData(...)`. This approach avoids the “Property 'DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME' does not exist” error, because Amplify will generate that variable only if you explicitly define it in your function’s resource config.

Below is a comparative analysis of each chatbot response, measured against the **baseline** answer from Stack Overflow:

---

## Baseline Answer (Summary)

The user needs to set up a Gen 2 Amplify function that can insert data into a DynamoDB table created via Amplify’s data resource. They found that environment variables like `DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME` and `AWS_REGION` aren’t automatically available for the function, whereas for S3 they might have been auto-generated. The baseline answer says:

> Amplify Gen2 doesn’t automatically generate environment variables for the table. You must either define them in your function’s resource config or use the recommended approach of “gen2-lambda-to-data” bridging, typically with an approach like:
> 
> ```ts
> // amplify/functions/<funcName>/resource.ts
> export const functionResource = defineFunction({
>   access: [ data.Todo ], // grants the function read/write on that table
>   environment: {
>     DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME: data.Todo.tableName
>   }
> });
> ```
> 
> …then import them in your function’s code from `$amplify/env/<funcName>`. That yields typed environment variables. Also ensure you do an `amplify push` so the environment variables and IAM permissions get updated properly.

Hence the main point: **the user must explicitly define environment variables** in the function resource file to get a typed variable for `DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME`. The user can’t just rely on them existing automatically.

## Chatbot Response #1

**1. Accuracy**  
- They mention that Amplify does not automatically set environment variables for DynamoDB tables. They suggest manually specifying them in the function’s config or referencing the table name. They also mention the function’s role must have the needed permissions.  
- This aligns well with the baseline, which says you must define environment variables or use the recommended approach.  
Rating: **Satisfactory**

**2. Completeness**  
- They list the steps: retrieving the table name, define environment variables in `resource.ts`, use `access: [data.Todo]`, ensure IAM policy. That’s precisely the baseline method.  
Rating: **Satisfactory**

**3. Clarity**  
- It’s quite well structured.  
Rating: **Satisfactory**

**4. Practicality**  
- The user can follow these steps and fix the problem.  
Rating: **Satisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #1)**: **Satisfactory**

## Chatbot Response #2

**1. Accuracy**  
- The response suggests a CDK approach, injecting environment variables via `backend.ts`, etc. That’s a valid approach for advanced usage, but not quite the standard Gen 2 approach. The baseline basically says define environment in the function resource. 
- #2 focuses heavily on the CDK approach in `amplify/backend.ts`. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory** (CDK approach is valid but doesn’t match the baseline’s simpler direct resource approach.)

**2. Completeness**  
- They do mention letting the function read / write to the table, but they push a certain advanced approach using `Stack`. The baseline just uses the standard approach with `defineFunction`. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory** (They skip describing how to do it purely in the function’s resource file.)

**3. Clarity**  
- Reasonable, but more advanced / less straightforward than the baseline. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

**4. Practicality**  
- The user might not need a full custom `backend.ts` with manual CDK calls. The baseline’s simpler approach might be easier. 
**Rating**: **Partially Satisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #2)**: **Partially Satisfactory**

- Mentions the user can define environment variables in `resource.ts` for the function, referencing `data.Todo.tableName`, plus using the `access` property. 
- That’s exactly the baseline approach. 
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

**2. Completeness**  
- They mention how to define `environmentVariables`, how to use `coalescing from Amplify’s references`, how to do a `coalesce(wc.start_read_time_local, g.read_start)`, though that might be from a different context? Actually wait, that might be leftover from a different Q. 
- Actually the snippet about the environment suggests “(the user can do environment: …)”. They also mention verifying AWS region. 
**Rating**: **Satisfactory** (Yes, it covers the main points.)

**3. Clarity**  
- The solution is well structured. 
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

**4. Practicality**  
- They show the user how to do it in `resource.ts` with `environmentVariables`. 
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #4)**: **Satisfactory**

## Chatbot Response #5

**1. Accuracy**  
- Tells the user to do the standard approach: in the function’s resource definition, specify `environmentVariables: { DATA_TODO_TABLE_NAME: data.models.Todo.tableName }` and `access: [ data.models.Todo ]`. This is precisely the baseline approach. 
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

**2. Completeness**  
- Mentions the `defineFunction`, the `environmentVariables`, the `amplify push`. This matches the baseline well. 
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

**3. Clarity**  
- The steps are well explained. 
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

**4. Practicality**  
- Very practical. 
**Rating**: **Satisfactory**

**Overall Rating (Response #5)**: **Satisfactory**

# Summary

The baseline approach is: you must define environment variables for your function in the function’s resource file, referencing the table name from your data resource, and also set `access: [data.Todo]`.

**Response #1, #4, and #5**: All match the baseline’s approach quite well.  
**Response #2**: Recommends a more complicated CDK approach, not exactly the baseline approach but partially correct.  
**Response #3**: Incomplete/truncated.

**Best**: #1, #4, or #5.  
**Worst**: #3.
